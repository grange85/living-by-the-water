# About
[Living by the water]({{ site.baseurl }}/) exists as a sort of exploration diary while we settle into the North East. It doesn't really have an aim or a purpose, and isn't really _for_ anything or anyone. But hopefully if you're interested in history, or culture, or food, or the North East it'll offer occasional mild distraction.

[This post]({{ site.baseurl }}/2021/09/02/living-by-the-water/) tries to explain things but I suspect what it turns into mightn't be what we expect it to be.

You can get in touch with us by emailing [livingbythewater@grange85.co.uk](mailto:livingbythewater@grange85.co.uk)

In case you want to know a little bit about us...

{: #andy}
Most of my online existence for 27 years has revolved around [A Head Full of Wishes](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk) which is all about the band [Galaxie 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxie_500) and the various acts that splintered off from it.

There's a neglected more general blog called [Everything's Swirling](https://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/) where I write about films and other music when I feel the urge.

I can also be found in all the usual places by [Googling _grange85_](https://google.com/search?q=grange85).
