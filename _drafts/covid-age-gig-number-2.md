Last night Hazel and I took our next tentative steps back into live music with a lovely (and free) gig in a pub in Sunderland. The first gig had been mostly acoustic gentle folk so it was nice (for me anyway) to see a band with drums and electric guitars -- and a little bit of wigging out.

Support was, however, mostly acoustic gentle folk - although it was provided by the always excellent, and regularly ramshackle, and unashamadely profane [Kathryn Williams](https://www.kathrynwilliams.co.uk/) who played a too short but otherwise wonderful set - no lows but the highs were Heart Shaped Stone and her cover of These Days - complete with short, Nico impression thrown in. She felt the need to prepare the audience for that so that it made sense (_although, it'd have made snese to me anyway_).

Main act where [Lanterns on The Lake](https://www.lanternsonthelake.com/news) who I'd last seen ten years previously at [Truck Festival](https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/albums/72157627148400125) when they played before Dean Wareham. I bought a couple of albums on the back of that but have sort of lost touch since - not for any reasons except that sort of happens. Last nights show was a treat, low key, charming, with a nice, rich variety and some lovely noise and the sort of rock that I've missed.

Next up it's Steeleye Span at The Whitley Bay Playhouse on Sunday.
