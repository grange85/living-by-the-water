It seems that a lot of the _things I knew_ about the North East might be music related - and probably with a leaning to a certain type of music.

Now I saw Motorhead a lot of times back in the 80s and the vast majority of those were at the Hammersmith Odeon, and we all know that Motorhead's No Sleep 'til Hammersmith is the greatest live album ever - but it was kind of a disappointment to us Londoners that none of that album was recorded at the Hammy Odeon.

The title refers to the fact that most tours ended in London. But, ironically not the tour on which No Sleep was recorded. The _Short, Sharp, Pain in the Neck_ tour did however include a couple of dates at The Newcastle City Hall and most of the album was taken from those shows.

Nothing makes this clearer than the intro to the fab We Are The Road Crew where the _loudest voice in any road crew_ introduces the song:

> Come on then Newcastle, let's hear it for the road crew

Obviously my slow (and small scale) return to gigging means that I've not yet paid a visit to the shrine that is the Newcastle City Hall - and sadly I'll not get to see Motorhead there when I do.
