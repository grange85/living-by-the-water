When we decided to move out of London we established a number of criteria that the place we moved to had to fulfill - this is the first of a series of posts which might help explain why we ended up in the North East of England despite having no historic or familial connection to the area.

Back in the early 2000s we decided that we could no longer justify owning and running a car. Having a wonderful public transport system in London meant there was no need for one, and it was time for us to stop being part of the environmental and social scourge that is car-ownership.

I have no desire to ever own a car again and so being able to get around easily without one was key. The concern of course was just how spoiled we'd been in London. London's underground, overground, buses and trams are an amazing resource, reasonably priced, and there's nowhere you can't get to or from, at any time of day or night. Our new home had a job to come anywhere close to that.

Tyne and Wear has _The Metro_, a light rail system. Overground except through Newcastle and Gateshead, and mostly built on former railways. It's made up of just two lines but covers a huge amount of ground and accommodates most of our needs. The timetables are pretty reliable and, now we're getting the hang of some of it's quirks, it's easy and quick to get where we want to be. 30 minutes into Newcastle City Centre and less than an hour to Sunderland.

The buses aren't so simple, or at least we haven't figured them out yet, it costs more to get home from Whitley Bay by bus than by Metro, which is weird (even cheaper to walk obviously) and not all providers accept the same payment card. Luckily we've not really had a need to make use of them - although that does mean there's still a great bit of the area - particularly to the west - that we haven't yet explored.

Because the bit along the coast where we live is built on former railways we're lucky to have some wonderful stations.

Tynemouth station is enormous, mostly empty space except at the weekends where an amazing, and amazingly popular, market is.

Whitley Bay is another glorious station with a very grand clock tower.
