<p>Over on Facebook in one of those... 'social' things that happen I was asked to answer a few questions about a randomly offered age. I was given 19, I was disappointed... I was much cooler at 20 (and much cooler than that at 35!).</p>
<p><strong>The age I was given by Chris was 19... it was 1983</strong></p>

<strong>Where I lived:</strong> Cobham, Surrey (actually a small village outside called Downside - to some it was idyllic to me it was oppressive).</p>

<p><strong>Who had my heart:</strong> Mot&ouml;rhead (but they were about to lose it to REM, The Long Ryders and The Pogues)</p>
<p><strong>My age now is 49, but only for a few more weeks.</strong></p>
