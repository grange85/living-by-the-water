<p>We saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346156/maindetails">Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow</a> on DVD at the weekend and what a pile of poo it turned out to be. Sure it looked fine enough (most of the time) but whoever was led to believe that either Gwyneth Paltrow	or Jude Law had the talent to carry this picture was sorely disillusioned. Sure they may have been hampered by a weak story and crap dialog but just maybe the action could have carried the film if the actors had been good enough. Angelina Jolie proved that she could turn a rubbish part with rubbish dialog in a rubbish film into something memorable. Utter Rubbish.</p><br /></p>
