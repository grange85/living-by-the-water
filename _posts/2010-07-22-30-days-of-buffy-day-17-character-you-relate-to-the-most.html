<p>I wanted to say Oz, because he's so very cool - but I'm really not <em>that</em> cool... not even close to Oz cool! I thought about Xander because he's a bit (quite a lot) of a nerd, but I'm really not anything like that... thankfully. I pondered Willow... but not clever enough and don't really love the books <em>that</em> much. Maybe Angel, for the broody, dressed-in-black thing!?
<p /> I'm not sure there's one I can really relate to but I'm going to pick Tara for her difficulty in social situations, her lacking in self-confidence and because of the being a bit quiet thing - now that sounds a bit like me...
