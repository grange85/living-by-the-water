<div>I just checked my <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a> charts and was surprised to discover just how much my listening has been a wallow in nostalgia over the last six months - here are my top 6 artists for that period with a few thoughts on each...
<p />  <br />1. <a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk">Galaxie 500</a> - of course. I&#39;m fairly certain that I&#39;ve barely gone a week without listening to Galaxie 500 since I came across them back in 1989!
<p /> 2. <a href="http://www.dragcity.com/artists/joanna-newsom">Joanna Newsom</a> - no wallowing in nostalgia here - just another perfect album which has had plenty of spins.
<p />3. <a href="http://www.scopitones.co.uk/">The Wedding Present</a> - a kind of nostalgia, although I only really fully realised my love for TWP after Cinerama
<p /> 4=. <a href="http://www.teenagefanclub.com/">Teenage Fanclub</a> - with the arrival of the new album, and my first Fannies gig for nearly 20 years I went back and loved those first three or four albums. The new one is not a match (and their gig wasn&#39;t as great as the olden days either) - but both were just good enough.
<p /> 4=. <a href="http://www.imotorhead.com/">Motorhead</a> - Surprised to see them so high - but I do turn to loud music at certain times and when I do I invariably turn to Motorhead.
<p />6. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Star">Big Star</a> - Alex Chilton&#39;s passing obviously contributed to this - I spent the week after his death listening to very little else.
<p /> I&#39;ll mention that in 7th place was Nina Nastasia because she has a great new album, a great back catalogue and because the top 7 were a fair distance ahead of the rest of the pack and it seems a shame to not recognise that just because of the arbitrary "6" I picked a while back.<br /> <object height="417" width="500"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/u_VNaThCRJc&hl=en&fs=1" /></param><param name="wmode" value="window" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/u_VNaThCRJc&hl=en&fs=1" allowfullscreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" wmode="window" height="417" width="500"></embed></object>
