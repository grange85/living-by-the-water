<p>I love so much about the internet, but sometimes YouTube is about the best thing there is. Obviously not most of it - but anything that means I can watch the following any time I like has to be pretty damn brilliant!</p>
<p>#1 - Obviously... Galaxie 500 playing under a basketball hoop<br />

<p>#2 - Beat Happening playing an in-store outside<br />

<p>#3 Ira and Georgia doing a YouTube thing years before there was YT<br />
{% aavid "FLG-lCrNH28" "" %}
<p>#4 Whistling Jack Smith because!<br />

<p>#5 It's James Last and his Orchestra playing Hawkwind's Silver Machine<br />
