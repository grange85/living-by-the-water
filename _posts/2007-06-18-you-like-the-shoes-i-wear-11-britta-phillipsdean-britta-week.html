<p><strong>Dean & Britta week</strong></p></p>
<div class="imagebox-a"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tammylo/528114836/" title="photo sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1111/528114836_eb16b2985f_m.jpg" alt="" style="border: solid 2px #000000;" /></a><br/><span style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 0px;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tammylo/528114836/">Dean &amp; Britta @ Luna Lounge</a><br/>(originally uploaded by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/tammylo/">tammylo</a>)</span></div><br />
I was looking for pictures of Britta wearing those knee high boots she seems to wear quite often - most notably in all the <a href="http://deanandbritta.com/_imgs2/performancesimg.jpg">promo shots for Back Numbers</a>. But then I came across this sweet picture of Britta wearing some sweet strappy heely sandals (I'm sure this type of shoe has a name but as this series progresses it's clear that my knowledge of footwear is very limited). They have heels and they have straps - and despite that they look comfortable - and much nicer than knee highs which have never really been my thing!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
#11 Britta Phillips (of <a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com">Dean and Britta</a>) in her strappy heeled sandals.<br />
