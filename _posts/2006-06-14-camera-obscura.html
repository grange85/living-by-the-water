<p>Finally have my paws on the new <a href="http://camera-obscura.net/">Camera Obscura</a> - and very lovely it is too. I had an email from <a href="http://www.elefant.com/en/noticia.php?id=4476">Elefant Records</a> proudly puffing the band's MySpace page and the fact that they were a MySpace featured band.</p>
<p>There's a nice <a href="http://camera-obscura.net/">Camera Obscura</a> website and the <a href="http://www.elefant.com/en/grupos_dis.php?id=5">Elefant</a> and <a href="http://www.mergerecords.com/band.php?band_id=88&amp;">Merge</a> sites have lots of info and a few goodies (including the video for "Lloyd...") so  you really shouldn't have to visit the vile MySpace - I try not too.</p><br />
