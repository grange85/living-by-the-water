The longest love affair I've had with a band that actually is still around is probably the one I have with <a href="http://www.yolatengo.com">Yo La Tengo</a>. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
There's a nice little interview/in studio performance you can listen to on <a href="http://woxy.lala.com/blog/2007/04/23/lounge-act-recap-yo-la-tengo/">Woxy.com</a> which includes them playing what is possibly, my favourite song from my favourite YLT album - Big Day Coming as well as a couple of Kinks numbers. There's a bunch of pictures from the performance on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/woxy/sets/72157600083417619/">Woxy's Flickr stream</a>.<br/><br />
