<p>Last Saturday I caught a very excellent bill at <a href="http://www.stgilesonline.org/">St Giles in the fields</a>. I was a bit concerned about the venue but all three bands seemed to accommodate the godly atmosphere in their own way. First up were <a href="http://www.shadybard.co.uk/">Shady Bard</a> who confidently rolled through their a very good set, maybe they deserve the buzz that seems to be surrounding them. Next up <a href="http://www.theclientele.co.uk/">The Clientele</a> who seemed to have a healthy amount of cocky disrespect for their surroundings and swaggered through a nice mix of old and new and very old. The disrespect was something that seemed to offend <a href="http://www.drownedinsound.com/event/view/20757">Daniel Ross at Drowned in Sound</a> who thinks that apparently "[a band] must respect [their] surroundings" which is of course utter nonsense (and it's not as if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusade">Christians always have respect</a> for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionary"><em>their</em> environment</a>). I'd heard only a little Sodastream before the show so was a little unsure about what to expect. They were tremendous, the two of them filled the church with a sound that maybe fitted the surroundings better than The Clientele, not "respect" just music that maybe comes from somewhere a little closer god or heaven! Definitely worth a listen.</p></p>
<p>Here's a grossly out of sync video (it was in sync before YouTube got their paws on it - I'll try and upload a new version when I can)<br/><br />
