<p>The very wonderful Kristin Hersh has just launched <a href="http://kristinhersh.cashmusic.org/">CASH Music</a> - the <strong>C</strong>oallition of <strong>A</strong>rtists & <strong>S</strong>take <strong>H</strong>olders is an attempt to make music and a living outside of the conventional industry way of doing things. It's a bold step that I sincerely hope is rewarded. Rather than selling her music she is giving it away (Creative Commons licensed), encouraging people to share and re-mix. To make money from this venture she is putting faith in the fact that people don't have a problem paying for music and will happily do it even if they're not forced or bullied to do so. Either by one off donation or by subscription we, as fans, can demonstrate that we appreciate that an artist needs money and if that artist shows faith and trust in us - we can return the favour...</p><br />
<blockquote>We're all stake holders here. We all stand to gain from a productive relationship. Maybe it will help to think of this relationship as a conversation. For instance, I start the conversation by writing and recording a song every month, like the one I'm posting here this month, "Slippershell". You respond by listening & sharing "Slippershell" with others.</blockquote>
