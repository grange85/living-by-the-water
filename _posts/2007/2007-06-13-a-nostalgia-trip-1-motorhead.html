<p>The last time I saw <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mot%C3%B6rhead" class="bbcode_artist">Mot&ouml;rhead</a> was probably back in 1983 when <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Robertson" class="bbcode_artist">Brian Robertson</a> was playing guitar for them. It might have been at the Marquee and may have been the very gig at which <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/grange85/journal/2007/04/30/410495/">I caught Lemmy's pick when he chucked it into the crowd</a>. Robertson left, the new tracks stuck on the <a title="Mot&ouml;rhead - No Remorse" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mot%C3%B6rhead/No+Remorse" class="bbcode_album">No Remorse</a> compilation were, without exception, grim listening and that was it for me and the band I had lived and breathed (and seen so many times) since 1979. I never stopped listening to them, they're pretty much the only band from my HM period that I do still dip into (OK and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/AC%252FDC" class="bbcode_artist">AC/DC</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Black+Sabbath" class="bbcode_artist">Black Sabbath</a>)...<a title="Mot&ouml;rhead - Overkill" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mot%C3%B6rhead/Overkill" class="bbcode_album">Overkill</a> and <a title="Mot&ouml;rhead - Ace of Spades" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mot%C3%B6rhead/Ace+of+Spades" class="bbcode_album">Ace of Spades</a> get a regular airing...<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Over the last few years whenever I notice that they're touring I get these bizarre little pangs of nostalgia that make me want to go see them but then I think that maybe I should just leave them in my past. There are some memories of seeing the band that I probably wouldn't want to get watered down by seeing the current incarnation (which as far as I can tell bears little resemblance to the band I loved).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
We were watching the Culture Show last weekend and an item on <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jarvis+Cocker" class="bbcode_artist">Jarvis Cocker</a>'s Meltdown festival mentioned that <a href="http://www.last.fm/event/226409" class="bbcode_event">Motorhead would be playing at the (newly revamped) Royal Festival Hall</a>...well that's just not something I'd be able to miss - Motorhead...at the Royal Festival Hall! I was surprised that tickets were still available and despite the price (30 quid a hit!!) I bought one for me and one for Adam.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I'm kind of ready for a disappointment - I know they're not the band I grew up with, I haven't listened to any Motorhead release since <a title="Mot&ouml;rhead - Orgasmatron" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mot%C3%B6rhead/Orgasmatron" class="bbcode_album">Orgasmatron</a> (and I only listened to that once!) and they've released a stack of albums since then, and I'm different...24 years worth of different...but maybe I'll lower my expectations and try and paint a nice nostalgic wash over the top of it...<br /><br />
