<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Espers" class="bbcode_artist">Espers</a> were probably great last night but I could barely hear them over the sound of chatting patrons and crushed plastic glasses.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
We arrived later than we'd hoped having missed <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Sharron+Kraus" class="bbcode_artist">Sharron Kraus</a> and halfway through <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Voice+of+the+Seven+Woods" class="bbcode_artist">Voice of the Seven Woods</a>. The venue was pretty packed and after a bit of shuffling about we found a decent spot next to the mixing desk. We could see the whole of the stage but unfortunately we could also hear the ignorant woman who chose to speak at the top of her voice during every song - I wished I had the nerve to do a Rube on her. I'd love to be able to stand up and point out to people when they're being selfish...<br /><br />

Rube: Afternoon ladies. Are you two old friends?<br /><br />
Cutter: Eh, her daughter is in my son's class.<br /><br />
Rube: I have a question for you. Is everyone in this line an asshole?<br /><br />
Cutter: Eh, excuse me?<br /><br />
Rube: Is everyone you just cut in front of an asshole?<br /><br />
Cutter: Eh, no.<br /><br />
Rube: So its just you then.<br /><br />
Cutter: I have children in the car.<br /><br />
Rube: I have a cake in the oven. He's got three minutes left on the meter, she's got a lunch meeting. We all have a finite amount of time. Now get in the back of the line. And don't use your children like that &mdash; it's shameful.<br /><br />
Cutter: Ehh. <em>(Goes to back of line)</em><br /><br />

<br /><br />
Anyway...we moved, we chose to go to a spot where we couldn't see a thing rather than have to listen to this ignorant persons fucking life story.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I closed my eyes (I couldn't see anything anyway) and tried to filter out the extraneous noise and when it was "just me" I started to enjoy the show but that's not the way I wanted it to be. Dingwalls is a dump for viewing with pillars and stairs and terraces - a myriad of things to get in the way (not to mention all the very tall people who seemed to be there last night). The bar staff were nice though so I'll give it points for that.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I've been seeing gigs at Dingwalls for 20+ years now but reckon that last nights was probably the last one I'll go see. I'm getting fussy in my old age!<br /><br />
