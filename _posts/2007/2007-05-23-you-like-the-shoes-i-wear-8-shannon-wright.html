I'm a very recent convert to <a href="http://www.touchandgorecords.com/bands/band.php?id=21">Shannon Wright</a> but the two albums I've downloaded have pretty much convinced me that I've been missing out on something...and part of that's a classic rock and roll look - jeans and trainers (OK I'm aware that downloaded albums can't really convey a <em>look</em> but I needed an excuse to squeeze this into a category!)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<a href="http://www.touchandgorecords.com/bands/album.php?id=407">Let In the Light</a> was released a couple of weeks back and is well worth a listen.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
MP3: <a href="http://www.touchandgorecords.com/media/3770.mp3">St. Pete</a> (4.4Mb)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
#7 Shannon Wright and her white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_shoe">trainers</a><br /><br />
<br clear="all" /></p>
