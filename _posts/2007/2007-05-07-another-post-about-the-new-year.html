Back in January I decided I'd start a tradition of <a href="http://blog.fullofwishes.co.uk/swirling/2007/01/02/the-new-year/">posting about The New Year</a> every new year - but one post a year is not good enough (even if they can only manage to release one album every three years).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
But they're <a href="http://www.thenewyear.net/shows.html">playing a few dates on the left side of the US</a> and hopefully they'll work they way around the globe and hit London sometime before the end of the year - preferably with album No. 3 in the bag.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<a href="http://www.tgrec.com/bands/album.php?id=424#">Touch and Go records have just posted video</a> of their appearance at last year's 25th anniversary show in Chicago - a couple of songs and a bit of an interview (about how great T&G are!) (via  <a href="http://www.bradleysalmanac.com/2007/05/monday-miscellany.htm">Bradley's Almanac</a>).<br />
<br clear="all" /></p>
