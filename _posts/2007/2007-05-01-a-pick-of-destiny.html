<p><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Damon%2B%2526%2BNaomi" class="bbcode_artist">Damon &amp; Naomi</a> are releasing the new <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Michio+Kurihara" class="bbcode_artist">Michio Kurihara</a> (ace guitarist and occasional member of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/GHOST" class="bbcode_artist">GHOST</a>) album <a href="http://www.20-20-20.com/catalogue/sunset.html">on their 20|20|20 record label</a> and early pre-orderers are to be treated to a limited edition guitar pick. Now, to be honest, a guitar pick is not really the sort of thing that's likely to sway me into parting with my money early - a poster or a print or a 7" single or a even a badge or a postcard are the sort of things that are more likely to sucker me into a purchase. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
A guitar pick to a non (or occasional) guitarist is just a piece of near-triangular plastic without a natural home - it doesn't hang or pin or stick anywhere and it will, no doubt, eventually fall down the back of a sofa or under a rug and never be seen again. I know this from experience because when I get my <em>"Do Moles Dream of Electric Guitars"</em> freebie it will be my second celebrity guitar pick...<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Many moons ago I saw <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mot%C3%B6rhead" class="bbcode_artist">Mot&ouml;rhead</a> at the Marquee Club (Wardour Street edition) it was crowded and hot, the floor was sticky and the walls were wet with condensation (as it always was), I shoved my way to near the front and enjoyed the band, like I always did. At the end of the show <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/lemmy" class="bbcode_artist">lemmy</a> just casually flicked his pick into the crowd and up shot my hand and it nestled neatly in my palm. In my memories there is a salmon-like leap and a dream-like slow motion sequence. Nothing like that had happened before or since - the drumsticks invariably flew over my head. There was nothing special - no gold trimmings or personalisation - just an ordinary pick like the millions you see in plastic boxes near the till in guitar shops.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I walked around with the pick tucked into the corner of my wallet for weeks, maybe months, showing it off proudly to anyone who cared (not so many folk I guess) and eventually it went the way of all those invconvenient mementoes. I sort of keep hoping that one day it'll turn up when I empty out a box of records or open a folder of my crap - but I suspect it never will. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
Maybe I'll just tuck Kurihara's pick into the CD cleeve and forget about it...<br /><br />
