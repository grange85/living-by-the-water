She was wearing daintier little strappy heels at the Albert Hall but I couldn't find any decent pics, and she does seem to wear these great clodhoppers more often (as can be seen a little clearer in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ilex/1234601012/">this rather odd picture</a>).<br />
<br clear="all" /></p>
