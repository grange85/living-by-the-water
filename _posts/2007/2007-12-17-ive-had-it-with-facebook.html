<p>I've just "deactivated" my Facebook account - after months of tinkering around the edges of it I just can't see what the point of it is and I think I need my social networks to have a point - Facebook seems to exist purely for it's own existence, which just isn't enough (or maybe too much) for me...</p>
<p>The social networks (with "points") where you can still find me are...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.last.fm/user/grange85/">Last.fm (music)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/grange85/">Flickr (photos)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.librarything.com/catalog/grange85">Library Thing (books)</a> (although I've only just tinkered with it and I'm not entirely convinced that I read enough to make it worth while...but I like the idea of having a record of what (little) I do read!</li></ul></p>
<p>Is there a decent film "network" around? <ins datetime="2007-12-17T14:47:09+00:00">Well...obviously Flixster - as it was one of the few things I discovered on Facebook as being interesting enough to follow up...you can (now) <a href="http://www.flixster.com/user/grange85">find me on Flixster</a>...</ins></p>
