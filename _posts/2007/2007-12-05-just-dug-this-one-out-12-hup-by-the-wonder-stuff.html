<p>I can't even imagine the point in my life when The Wonder Stuff fitted in. HUP was released in 1989, the same year that I first heard Galaxie 500 and the year after Sonic Youth's "Daydream Nation" was released. And yet here it is in my record collection and I have memories of seeing them two or three times including a drive down to see them at the dire Brighton Centre. They are certainly a band from my <em>previous life</em>, the one were I went to gigs with old school friends instead of new work mates, The Pogues, The Waterboys and <a href="http://blog.fullofwishes.co.uk/2007/07/02/just-dug-this-one-out-7-the-men-they-couldnt-hang/">The Men They Couldn't Hang</a> also fit into that category, and I guess like all of those bands it was the live experience more than the records that mattered.</p>
<p>Listening to the CD now it's baffling that I ever really liked it, occasionally the cathcy-pop elements sneak through and "Golden Green" had me nodding along. The intro to "Piece of Sky" also got my hopes up but ultimately it descended into the same chant-a-long, fist-waving, bouncy, jangly guitar pop that the rest of the album is overflowing with and which becomes tiresome quite quickly.</p>
<p>This is the second post in row to have raided <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36425903@N00/">Mark Benney's Flickr stream</a> for it's accompanying shot. Mark has uploaded <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36425903@N00/sets/">a stack of great photos</a> taken in the early 90s that seem to cover so many of the bands that I was seeing around then.</p><br />
