<p><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Flare" class="bbcode_artist">Flare</a> - <a title="Flare - Bottom" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Flare/Bottom" class="bbcode_album">Bottom</a><br /><br />
<br /><br />
I'm not sure how I came across Flare, I suspect it was on the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Low" class="bbcode_artist">Low</a> or <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Galaxie+500" class="bbcode_artist">Galaxie 500</a> mailing list many, many years ago. But having heard a little I rushed out and bought pretty much all that was available at that point which was this, their debut album, <a title="Flare - Circa" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Flare/Circa" class="bbcode_album">Circa</a> an EP, and a couple of 7" singles. Everything was superb but Bottom was just so beautiful (there should be some words telling you just <em>how</em> beautiful but I couldn't think of anything worthy enough).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
And then, like so many albums in my collection it sort of got lost in the filing and drifted out of my consciousness...I quite enjoyed last years <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/LD%2B%2526%2BThe%2BNew%2BCriticism" class="bbcode_artist">LD &amp; The New Criticism</a> album which inspired me to revisit Flare and then this morning I grabbed a pile of CDs from the 'f' section and I just fell in love with Bottom all over again...<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Confession time...<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Despite my love of this, and my appreciation of the various and varied works of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Stephin+Merritt" class="bbcode_artist">Stephin Merritt</a> I have never owned <a title="The Magnetic Fields - 69 Love Songs" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Magnetic+Fields/69+Love+Songs" class="bbcode_album">69 Love Songs</a>. I did order it once but something (I can't remember what) went wrong and it never arrived...and I just never got around to following up on it. Maybe because by that time it was getting so highly praised that the snob in me felt the need to resist.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
So I was never able to fully appreciate <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/davidjennings/" class="bbcode_user">davidjennings</a>'s <a href="http://69lovesongs.info/wiki/">wiki dedicated to the album</a> (I wanted to call it a love-wiki but it didn't sound as hilariously witty when I read it back to myself) and I'd sort of mumble incoherently and try not to give the game away whenever it got mentioned.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I've listened to <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Magnetic+Fields" class="bbcode_artist">The Magnetic Fields</a> <a title="The Magnetic Fields - Get Lost" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Magnetic+Fields/Get+Lost" class="bbcode_album">Get Lost</a> this week as well as Flare so I was inspired to fill this hole in my collection this afternoon.</p>
