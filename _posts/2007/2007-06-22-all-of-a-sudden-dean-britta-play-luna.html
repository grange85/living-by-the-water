Dean and Britta only played this one Luna song over the two London shows (although not counting Bonnie & Clyde and Indian Summer might be cheating a little). That's not a complaint, I got two very good (if a little short) D&B shows which is more than most of Europe got this time around.</p>
<p>Bewitched is possibly one of Luna's (bitter-)sweetest songs - and it pretty much has had me in a swoon live every time (and there's been quite a few times over the years). Wednesday night's version featured some guy I didn't know on trumpet <ins datetime="2007-06-24T22:40:48+00:00">(Britta's latest deanandbritta.com mailout revealed that Joe the sound man was the trumpeter)</ins> which just topped things off nicely (Luna missed having a trumpet on tour after Justin left).</p>
<p>I have recordings of both shows which I'll share them on Dimeadozen when I've sorted them out but in the meantime here's an mp3 of Dean & Britta doing bewitched at The Legion...</p>
