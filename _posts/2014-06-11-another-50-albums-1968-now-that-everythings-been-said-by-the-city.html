Just watched the BBC4 Carole King documentary which had a lovely start just rattlinmg through the amazing songs intercut with home movies, live clips, and a late 70s (or early 80s) interview - got a bit tired towards the end, particularly when it turned into an advert for the Carole King jukebox musical.</p>
<p>But Carole is just adorable... and so many songs. Now listening to <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/1dhhTa6Pe8q3zd9zuuK5op">Now That Everything's Been Said by The City</a>, which I'd heard of, but not heard. I know I shouldn't say this out loud but I love Spotify!</p>
<p>It's Carole King... in a band, and is just as good as that statement suggests it would be.</p>
