<p>Kristin is a treasure. She is unique both in her music and in her vision. She makes music for the best reasons and in <a href="http://cashmusic.org/">Cash Music</a> she kicked off a model of the future that I can understand. And on top of that she keeps making stunning music. My love for Kristin is unbounded.</p>

<p>It's prob too recent for "of the decade" status but I'm sure in years to come <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Songs">Popular Songs</a> will be in this list and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Sun">Summer Sun</a> probably should be too! YLT are consistent without being obvious and variable without ever being disappointing or frustrating. I expect them to keep not disappointing me for many years to come.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespertine">Vespertine</a> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B6rk">Bjork</a></strong></p>
<p>I have so much time for Bjork but a lot of that time is spent in the company of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sugarcubes">The Sugarcubes</a>. There's something a little big about her solo work that makes me inclined to shy away from it. I buy them all and listen occasionally but rarely actually love. Vespertine is the exception, it is closer to how I want Bjork to be.</p></p>
