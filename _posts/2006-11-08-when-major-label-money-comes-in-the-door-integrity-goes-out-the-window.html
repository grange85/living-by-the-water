<p>I sort of hate how I keep picking on <a href="http://www.decemberists.com">The Decemberists</a> because deep down I think they're probably a good bunch of people and what's happening is just the standard shit that happens when you sign to a major label. A few years ago I signed up to a "a relatively unobtrusive once a month email missive" from Decemberists. It was irregular but when the posts came it was clea that they hand-crafted with love and humour and genuinely interesting content.</p></p>
<p>When I signed up I was told<br />
<blockquote>This is a hidden list, which means that the list of members is available only to the list administrator.</blockquote> this was clearly a lie because today I recieved my email not from the Decemberists but from EMI Capitol so obviously the list was available to the list administrator AND the PR department at Capitol Records</p></p>
<p>This was no lovingly written news missive but just a puff for the album, it had no content of any note and certainly no humour just a horrid dry email with pictures/adverts and a couple of links to more pages of puff.</p></p>
<p>Maybe there is a very good reason to sign to a major but I must admit I find it very hard to believe that there is <a href="http://www.arancidamoeba.com/mrr/problemwithmusic.html">and so does Steve Albini</a>. So, if there are any bands I love who happen to come past here (oh I'm sure they all do!) please think that maybe having a bit of integrity is worth a little more than whatever it is that the major label is offering you.</p></p>
