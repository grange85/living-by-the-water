I've picked "Whipped Cream..." because the age of the internet has turned that sleeve from saucy charity-shop fodder into an icon.</p>
<p>I grew up with boxes and boxes of records and in amongst them were plenty of Herb Alpert albums, I'd be very surprised if this wasn't one of them, of course this was old folks music so it was never me who'd put on a record like this which is kind of sad because it is fun, although it tends to be more fun on the songs I know.</p>
<p>It opens with A Taste of Honey, the first music I can remember really loving was The Beatles Twist & Shout EP that had A Taste of Honey on it - although Do You Want to Know a Secret was my fave on that.</p>

<p>Wikipedia tells me that bass session legend Carol Kaye played on this album - I'd be surprised if she didn't turn up again.<br />
