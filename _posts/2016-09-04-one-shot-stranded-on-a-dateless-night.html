I've been slowly sorting through my CDs and came across my copy of Alex Chilton Live in London that I picked up many, many moons ago - probably the late 80s or very early 90s. </p>
<p>I was superficially aware of Alex Chilton before I really knew Big Star, through The Letter, which I had on a 60s compilation LP (probably more than one).</p>
<p>During a short-lived, early 80s foray into Psyhcobilly I bought a compilation album called <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Various-Rockabilly-Psychosis-And-The-Garage-Disease/release/394550">Rockabilly Psychosis and the Garage Disease</a> that was pretty much my Psychobilly bible (along with the (first two) Blood on the Cats comps). It had some old gems - Psycho by The Sonics, The Crusher by The Novas; and some new gems by the likes of The Guana Batz, The Cramps and The Meteors. </p>
<p>But possibly my fave track on the album was Tav Falco's Panther Burns Dateless Night. A few years later I bought <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Tav-Falcos-Panther-Burns-The-World-We-Knew/release/1781735">The World We Knew </a>on the strength of Dateless Night ... and a couple of years on I became aware of Big Star.<br />

<p>The track is a pretty straight cover of an Alan (Allen) Page track from the late 50s<br />

<p>An instrumental version is on the reissues of Like Flies on Sherbert but I'm not too sure when this dates from<br />
{% aavid "Jyo_kEZngSc" "" %}
<p>I rather love hearing Alex's voice on the version on Live in London<br />

<p>Most of the 80s rockabilly/psyhcobilly revivalists have had a pop at Dateless Night but they're all pretty straight and often fairly dull, so instead here's Tav Falco performing the song a couple of years back in New Orleans<br />

<p>I only saw Alex once, when the reformed Big Star arrived in London with The Posies on the back of the Ryko reissues in 1992. </p>
