<p>I guess this might be the last time I talk about my <em>Favourite Hitchcock film</em> - I've talked about it in my posts on <a href="/swirling/2017/08/05/hitch-20-the-39-steps/">The 39 Steps</a> and <a href="/swirling/2018/03/04/hitch-23-young-and-innocent-1937/">Young and Innocent</a> - and neither of those films have a 10 because ... what if I love The Lady Vanishes more!?</p>
<p>In 2012, the BFI had a Hitch season ~ it was their little bit of cultural Olympics. Hazel and I went and saw quite a few of them (at least 12, maybe more). One of the highlights was seeing The Lady Vansihes in a full NFT 1 - there was something beautiful about being in a room full of people watching this film - most of whom knew it, and knew it well.</p>
<p>I do love the film - Iris and Gilbert are lovely together (although Gilbert is such an arse at the beginning it's a wonder she tolerates him at all). I love the way the dialog fizzes ("cut it out kid, you're not drugged") - I love the stereotypes ("tea time, well all the English will be there") - I adore the fight in the luggage car ("don't stand hopping about there like a referee, cooperate. Kick him, see if he's got a false bottom") - I adore the model work, the sets, the gags and the happy ending.</p>
<p>But it's not a 10, and it's probably not my favourite Hitch film - I think maybe <a href="/swirling/2017/08/05/hitch-20-the-39-steps/">The 39 Steps</a> got short-changed after all.</p>
<p>... although when we saw all those films in 2012 the only one I rated 10 then was... <a href="/swirling/2018/03/04/hitch-23-young-and-innocent-1937/">Young and Innocent</a>!</p>
<p>It's probably one of those three though. Except... there's Shadow of a Doubt...</p>
