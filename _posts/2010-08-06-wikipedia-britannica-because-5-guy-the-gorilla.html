<div>So <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-10861323">London Zoo is getting a new male gorilla</a>. There was a time when the gorilla at London Zoo was one of Britain&#39;s most famous residents. I think it went something like The Queen then Winston Churchill then Bobby Charlton and then Guy the Gorilla.
