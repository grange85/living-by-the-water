<p>Last year, in an effort to keep track of the years great albums I'd blog about an album I loved - for no other reason than as a reminder. I intended doing the same this year - but this year has been funny - I still haven't managed to get used to the downloaded = owned thing - so it took me a while to realise that I owned some great albums from this year even if I couldn't hold them. So this is catch-up. I only have physical copies of two of these albums - which is bothering me a little...<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<span title="Unknown album" class="bbcode_unknown">Low - Drums and Guns</span><br /><br />
After the near-grunge annoyance of The Great Destroyer with Drums and Guns it seems <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Low" class="bbcode_artist">Low</a> are heading back in towards being the band I love. This is the first Low album since <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Low/Secret+Name" class="bbcode_album">Low - Secret Name</a> that is likely to make my end of year lists. Maybe it's all relative - maybe it's not better than <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Low/Things+We+Lost+in+the+Fire" class="bbcode_album">Low - Things We Lost in the Fire</a> but it is an improvement on the previous album (which TWLITF clearly wasn't).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<span title="Unknown album" class="bbcode_unknown">Blonde Redhead - 23</span><br /><br />
It took almost three years for me to like <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Blonde+Redhead" class="bbcode_artist">Blonde Redhead</a>'s previous album <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Blonde+Redhead/Misery+Is+a+Butterfly" class="bbcode_album">Blonde Redhead - Misery Is a Butterfly</a>, but I love it now. 23 worked its magic a little quicker<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Kristin+Hersh/Learn+To+Sing+Like+A+Star" class="bbcode_album">Kristin Hersh - Learn To Sing Like A Star</a><br /><br />
There seems to be such a blurry line between <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Kristin+Hersh" class="bbcode_artist">Kristin Hersh</a>'s projects - this is the solo album that could almost be a <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Throwing+Muses" class="bbcode_artist">Throwing Muses</a> album - which is a good thing. And it is a good thing.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Deerhoof/Friend+Opportunity" class="bbcode_album">Deerhoof - Friend Opportunity</a><br /><br />
Maybe it's because this is supposed to be <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Deerhoof" class="bbcode_artist">Deerhoof</a> being accesible that I can get it more than the bits of Deerhoof I've heard previously - but I do get it and it is good.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<span title="Unknown album" class="bbcode_unknown">Alasdair Roberts - The Amber Gatherers</span><br /><br />
<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Alasdair+Roberts" class="bbcode_artist">Alasdair Roberts</a> has been on my "must listen properly sometime" list for a while - this album made me sit up and notice and him - now I have to work backwards.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<span title="Unknown album" class="bbcode_unknown">Dean and Britta - Back Numbers</span><br /><br />
Obviously. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jane%2BBirkin%2B%2526%2BSerge%2BGainsbourg" class="bbcode_artist">Jane Birkin &amp; Serge Gainsbourg</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nancy%2BSinatra%2B%2526%2BLee%2BHazlewood" class="bbcode_artist">Nancy Sinatra &amp; Lee Hazlewood</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Dean+and+Britta" class="bbcode_artist">Dean and Britta</a>. Sometimes I wince at how far Dean is now from <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Galaxie+500" class="bbcode_artist">Galaxie 500</a> - but then I just stop caring - The Sun is Still Sunny.<br /><br />
