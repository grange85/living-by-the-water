<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/">John Peel Day</a> came and went - I never got out to any of the gigs - but then it takes so much to get me out these days I guess that isn't much of a surprise. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/johnpeelday/2005/onr1/">I listened to chunks of the Radio 1 broadcast</a> that ranged from the cool and fun to the strange and uncomfortable but it was all pulled together in a haphazard way.</p></p>
<p>The BBC <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/">Keeping It Peel</a> website took the opportunity to pull together a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/artists/">thorough A-Z of all the artists</a> that have appeared either in session or in the Festive 50s over the years complete with some 30 second soundclips to tantalise the taste buds without giving proper satisfaction</p></p>
<p>There's also a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/sessions/top125/">top 125 Peel sessions</a> as compiled by John's family, friends and colleagues and while it unforgiveably misses out the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/sessions/1990s/1990/Oct30galaxie500/">second Galaxie 500 session</a> (come on Galaxie 500 covering the Sex Pistols has to be worth a place in anyone's chart and surely can't really be less worthy that PWEI or Gary Numan!). But given the list (Ballboy, Low, Nina Nastasia, Billy Bragg ... (none of whom made it onto the radio on Peel night <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/johnpeelday/2005/onr1/">according to the tracklisting</a>)) it's hard to complain too much.</p></p>
<p>Luckily for us all come November the Galaxie 500 Peel Sessions are finally getting the official release they deserve.</p>
<p>Galaxie 500 - Peel Sessions (20/20/20): <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/B000BOH93Q&amp;link_code=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=aheadfullofwi-20&amp;creative=9325">Amazon.com</a> | <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/B000BOH93Q&amp;link_code=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;tag=aheadfullofwi-21&amp;creative=6738">Amazon.co.uk</a></p>
