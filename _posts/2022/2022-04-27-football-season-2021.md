I'm not sure what I like about football - pretty certain it's not what most people like about it. But I do rather love non-league (and lower league) football, maybe because, as a Wimbledon fan, most of my football watching has been on sparsely populated terraces. 

I had been to very few matches in the years before we moved North, just the odd Wimbledon match when Adam could talk me into it, but arriving in the North East seemed to fire something unexpected and found me spending a few weekends and evenings standing on sparsely populated terraces... here's a very quick round up.

So... this lot will probably be _my North East team_ because they'll be my local team and that's who you should support. So I guess it's appropriate that they have treated me to a rather uninspired season.

I love the FA Cup, particularly the early rounds - there's something beautiful about lowly teams having dreams of cup glory. A lot of the games I went to this season were cup games, and Gateshead had a good run in the cup so I saw them quite a few times. 

Gateshead reached the second round and put up a decent showing against Charlton

I guess if I were a glory hunter I would have chosen North Shields as _my North East team_ but that's not how it works, also their ground _The Morgue_ is a charmless field whereas Whitley Bay's _Hillheads_ feels like it's been lived in.

I headed down to the south coast to see _The Robins_ play Littlehampton

#### The others

We went to Spennymoor Town becuase it was the FA Cup - turns out that was a mistake as it was a truly dreadful 0-0 draw - and annoyingly, becuase of that, it was the most memorable day!

I went to [Percy Main Amateurs](https://www.pitchero.com/clubs/percymainamateursfc) becuase ... because why wouldn't I want to see a team called Percy Main Amateurs.

There was one more match ... Wimbledon's first defeat of the season at Sunderland - things went badly downhill for The Dons after this - and they're headed for League Two ... and some sparsely populated terraces.
