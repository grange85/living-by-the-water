Between 1980 and 1986 I saw Motorhead pretty much every time they played at The Hammersmith Odeon - and they played there ... a lot.

In 1982 Motorhead released the live album **No Sleep 'til Hammersmith** - probably the finest live album ever released, and ... _Hammersmith_ in the album title - so ... when it came out I thought "in amongst that roar is me".

Turns out I was wrong - it didn't take too long to find out becuase at the beginning of _(We Are The) Road Crew_ a member of the crew introduces the song with the words "... come on Newcastle, let's hear it for the road crew!"

So, things I (eventually) knew about the North East ... 

_Most of No Sleep 'til Hammersmith was recorded over two nights at The City Hall, Newcastle._

You won't hear me in the roar.

[This blog has some splendid snaps by of Motorhead at The City Hall](https://garyalikivi.com/2019/03/30/roksnaps-6/) on the Short Sharp Pain In The Neck tour that produced _No Sleep_ - photos by Dave Curry, one of which I've lifted without permission - hope you don't mind Dave (if you ever come across this).
