It really took us far too long to get to [The Star and Shadow](https://starandshadow.org.uk/), a volunteer run community cinema (and more), but then it's been hard to get back into the swing of things so ... I guess not a surprise.

It was an odd turn of events that finally got us there. For some reason Hazel had kept a promo poster for the Australian film Celia from 1989, I think she'd seen it at the time. I hadn't even heard of it. But when we moved north the poster appeared and has been sitting on our bookshelf since then.

Last night Celia was showing at The Star and Shadow and given that we'd been looking at the poster of it for six months it would have been ridiculous for us not to head out to see it.

The cinema exterior is a little unprepossessing - no glorious art-deco palace but a former furniture showroom. But the exterior hides a charming space with [a beautiful conceit](https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/about/sas/) - the seats were comfy, the beer was served in glasses, the volunteers were all lovely.

The film wasn't too bad either although it sort of lost it's way in the last third a bit, but worth catching if you get the chance.

I can't believe we won't be spending plenty more time at The Star and Shadow - it certainly seems to have the sort of programming that suits us - it's where silent films get shown and where, in a few weeks time, we'll be seeing [Agnes Varda's masterpiece Cléo de 5 à 7](https://starandshadow.org.uk/programme/event/cleo-from-5-7,5957/) again.

_It's been months since I posted here I really have to try harder!_
