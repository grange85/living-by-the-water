<p>The Clientele are a four piece now, having added (and placed centre stage) a violin/keyboard/percussion player.</p>
<p>The set was a mix of classics ((I Want You) More Than Ever and Since K Got Over Me) along with a few tracks from their next album God Save The Clientele (out in April) and a couple of covers (A Picture Of Dorian Grey and The Fire).</p>
<p>The chatty crowd were a little annoying - soliciting a "Shut the fuck up" from Alasdair which only partly worked but all told another good Clientele gig.</p>
