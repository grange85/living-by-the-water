<p>I bought the Coltrane/Monk CD last year and was disappointed that it had "Copy Control" and that Blue Note had decided to treat me like a thief. I <a href="http://www.pledgebank.com/boycottdrm">pledged to never buy another copy-protected</a> CD and this is making my journey into jazz all the more problematic. I went to Amazon today to buy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Blakey">A Night in Tunisia</a> - it too was corrupt - I didn't and <b>WILL NOT</b> buy it.</p>
<p>I just rattled off a whiny "feedback" to <a href="http://www.bluenote.com">Blue Note</a> before I realised that it was to <a href="http://www.bluenote.com">Blue Note US</a> and they, it seems, are not corrupting their discs. It also seems that contacting <a href="http://www.bluenoteeurope.com">Blue Note in the UK</a> is not so easy to do so I guess I'll just add my whine here.</p>
<p>I'm relatively new to Jazz, I took up piano at the age of 39 (nearly three years now) and it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelonious_Monk">Thelonious Monk</a> who made me realise that jazz could have the same feel-beyond-musicianship that rock music has given me for years.</p>
<p>Following on from that it's been a thoroughly enjoyable journey discovering so much music that I didn't realise was there and so much of that music was on Blue Note. </p>
<p><b>Please</b> Blue Note (UK) reconsider the decision to sell corrupted discs and start treating your customers with a little respect - we do deserve it. </p>
<p>Apparentluy Blue Note in the US release uncorrupted CDs - I may just have to consider importing my jazz from now on in</p>
<p><b>update:</b> I managed to get a nice old vinyl copy fon eBay for about &pound;4  - fantastic album and well worth hunting down - but DON'T buy a corrupt CD from Blue Note (Europe).</p></p>
