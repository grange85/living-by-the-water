<p>Back in the early 80s I started hanging around with Ian and I have to acknowledge a debt to him. Ian was a blues afficianado, and I'm faily certain that some of the great (and memorable) gigs I went to in the early 80s where down to him. I saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lee_Hooker">John Lee Hooker</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Guy">Buddy Guy</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Green_%28musician%29">Peter Green</a> (during his mad long-fingernails obscurity), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Lee">Alvin Lee</a> and plenty more because Ian suggested them. He was also responsible for bits of my record collection from that period... and Blues Breakers was undoubtedly bought at his urging.</p>
<p>Ian was, above everything else, a HUGE Clapton fan, we used to go to crappy Surrey pubs in the hopes that Clapton would make an appearance... I'm fairly certain he never did. I have a problem with Clapton, always have even back then. Sure I liked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream_%28band%29">Cream</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yardbirds">The Yardbirds</a> well enough (thanks to Ian) but pretty much all he's done since has made these toes curl, he pretty close to ruined bits of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Things_Must_Pass">All Things Must Pass</a> and he is the proud owner of the song I hate more than any others). But I took a chance on this because it was the most highly regarded album of the British blues (played by white folk) boom.</p>
<p>I haven't listened to this for over 25 years... possibly nearer to 30, however I did expect it to be familiar, and half-expected to actually quite like it. It wasn't, and I didn't. It was mostly awful, a couple of tolerable tracks but otherwise tedious. Midway through I resorted to using the skip button more than I'd have liked... but by then I just needed to get through it and get something I wanted to hear into my ears.</p>
<p>So Ian, if you do ever read this, thanks for a lot of what you gave me... but not for this.</p>
