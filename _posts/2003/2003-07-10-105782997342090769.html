<p>In <a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com/dbdocs/Tournotes.html">her notes</a> about the recent [Luna/Deana and Britta] visit to Portugal Britta Phillips mentions eating "chicken and rice with blood" - as a vegetarian this strikes me as truly abhorent, I mean it's bad enough people eating meat but wallowing so gratuitously in the animals death is a little galling! I expect its name was cool and romantic in Potuguese.</p></p>
<p>I always get a little disappointed when people I like expose their carnivorous ways - I remember hearing Laetitia Sadier (Stereolab) on the radio describing the most frightening things she eats...</p></p>
<p>It's my problem one day I'll learn to accept that not everyone is a socialist-vegetarian - then I can get a little more pleasure from the ones that are without being disappointed by the rest!</p></p>
