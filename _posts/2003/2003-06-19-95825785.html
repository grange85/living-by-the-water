<p><strong>Records...we had thousands of records...they're still around...thousands of them. Most of them were crap. </strong></p></p>
<p>My dad has a dangerous combination of qualities...</p>
<ul>
<li>an obsessive hoarder</li>
<li>an inability to distinguish good from bad</li>
<li>a very big attic</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>So...we had thousands of records - a living statement that quantity was better than quality - actually often the albums themselves would encapsulate this statement in their titles  - whether it was <a href="http://www.spaceagepop.com/garrett.htm">"50 Guitars Visit Hawaii"</a> or "101 Strings Put You To Sleep". Ok in amongst all this quantity lurked some quality. I heard a lot of Beatles, Nancy Sinatra and The Beach Boys while growing up. But I also heard a lot of the <a href="http://www.btinternet.com/~mur/IdiAmin.htm">dreadful John Bird pretending to be Idi Amin</a> (which my dad did, and probably still would, find hilarious) and an awful thing called <a href="http://ntl.matrix.com.br/pfilho/html/lyrics/h/hut_sut_song.txt">"The Hut Sut Song"</a> that he would play to anyone who visited.</p></p>
<p>My mum would listen to most of what my dad inflicted on her but with a bit of country thrown in. This was the seventies, country was tassled jackets and cowboy hats, country was Tammy and Dolly and Don Williams.</p></p>
<p>My brother discovered "disco" as a music and as a place to go...</p></p>
<p>I reached 14 (1978) and I needed to break free from this muddle of good, bad and ugly music - <a href="http://www.imotorhead.com">and I did...</a></p></p>
