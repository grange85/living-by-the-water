<div>Not being part of the <a href="http://whedonesque.com/">Buffy fanatics world</a> I tend to only know who "everyone else hates" thanks to Hazel. <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2010/07/23/30-days-of-buffy-day-19/">In her post</a> she mentions Riley (who I don&#39;t really mind that much), Kennedy (who was a bit annoying) and Dawn... Dawn!? Dawn was great... or at least could have been great, except that after The Gift they didn&#39;t really know waht to do with her. And Michelle Trachtenberg was lovely so clearly if "everyone else hates" Dawn and I clearly don&#39;t then I guess that&#39;s Day 19 sorted...
<p /> Character I like that everyone else hates is Dawn...
