<p>The new album from <a href="http://www.theclientele.co.uk/">The Clientele</a> is out on September 5th (a bit later in the USA). I managed to miss their show in London last night - I'll blame the terror attacks for wanting to stay at home but it really is nothing less than plain old laziness</p></p>
