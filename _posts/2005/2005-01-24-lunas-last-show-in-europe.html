<p>Luna's last show (in Europe)</p>
<p>Kind of sweet and sort of emotional and a little bit odd and a lot wonderful and a tad tearful. Luna's last European show at ULU in London last week was everything it should have been (except maybe an hour or two longer). A packed house and an enthusiastic audience saw the band rattle through a fine set...and afterwards we all went home...with our lives a little bit emptier than when we had arrived.</p><br /></p>
