<p>Not my list yet - I'm still having to think about that! BUT Tom at <a href="http://www.indie-mp3.co.uk/blog/blog.htm">Indie MP3</a> has published  a <a href="http://www.indie-mp3.co.uk/blog/2005/12/list-2005.html">"list encompassing all that [he] enjoyed in 2005"</a> which, with the exception of Decoration (who I've been not too impressed with) and a sizeable handful of stuff I don't know (but am following up in earnest), contains a lot of very VERY fine music (and labels) indeed.</p></p>
