<p>Rumours abound that the Decemberists are about to sign to a major label (Capitol) (via <a href="http://www.donewaiting.com/archives/2005/11/rumor_decemberi.php">donewaiting.com</a>) - I worry at the prospect and here's why</p>
<p>Majors think "How many records CAN we sell" (to make as much money as<br />
possible - for US and our shareholders). Indies think "How many records do we HAVE to sell" (so we don't lose<br />
money and possibly earn a few pennies to invest in the next band)</p>
<p>Majors are only interested in shipping "units" and as such stifle creativity. Creativity is fostered in the independent sector, where the music and artistry is appreciated.</p>
<p>Indies take chances on unknowns, Majors allow the Indies to take those risks and then prune off the "most likely".</p>
<p>There are no doubt exceptions but I'd always have more respect for a big band on an (big) indie than an "alt" band on a conglomerate.</p>
<p>Signing to a major label means that you are no longer working for someone who likes music - you're working for a corp whose intention is nothing more than getting a decent return on their investment for the shareholders - consideration for the artist's integrity is a minor issue. They don't sign bands because of quality they sign bands because of sales (or sales potential) - sometimes they get quality as a bonus! To sell the amount of records that a major requires invariably means compromising in some way</p>
<p>Major labels also have an unhealthy disrespect for the consumer - Capitol is part of EMI who pioneered "Copy Control" - if The Decemberists sign for a major don't expect to be able to play their next CD anywhere you like...</p>
<p>I really hope that the Decemberists decide to "pay their dues". The independent sector is what makes music - the majors just exploit.
