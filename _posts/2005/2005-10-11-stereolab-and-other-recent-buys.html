<p>I bought the new <a href="http://www.stereolab.co.uk/">Stereolab</a> singles last week from my <a href="http://www.normanrecords.com/">indie online retailer of choice</a> - I'm like a Stereolab junkie - I stopped enjoying their releases ages ago but I've found it really hard to kick the habit. I played <a href="http://www.stereolab.co.uk/discography/?no=141">all</a> <a href="http://www.stereolab.co.uk/discography/?no=142">three</a> <a href="http://www.stereolab.co.uk/discography/?no=143">singles</a>, both sides, back-to-back and sat on the sofa unmoved, distant and a little sad - their cool-loungey-jazz sounds just washed right over me - it wasn't uncomfortable but it wasn't exciting or refreshing. I then put on <a href="http://www.stereolab.co.uk/discography/?no=12">Lo Boob Oscillator</a>, <a href="http://www.stereolab.co.uk/discography/?no=9">John Cage Bubblegum</a> and <a href="http://www.stereolab.co.uk/discography/?no=4">The Light That Will Cease to Fail</a> and just wanted to cry at how Stereolab had "improved" over the years.</p></p>
<p>I can't help but worry at my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite">Luddite</a> tendencies - but so many bands stopped making music <b>for me</b>.</p></p>
<p><b>Other recent purchases</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Set Free - <a href="http://www.amanset.com">American Analog Set</a> - I've had this for a week and haven't listened to it yet - I'm a little worried that its NOT a return to form - I may keep it unplayed and pretend that its better than their last three albums</li>
<li>Coles Corner - Richard Hawley - another reason for not playing the Amanset album might be that this has been hogging my time - a very lovely album - highly reccomended</li>
<li>It's Art Dad - <a href="http://www.theclientele.co.uk/">The Clientele</a> - Excellent collection of early Clientele recordings - <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendID=19066424&amp;blogID=52215895">go buy this</a> - but go buy Strange Geometry first which is released today by Merge (but has been available on Pointy in the UK for a while and is essential!)<br />
</li><br />
</ul></p>
