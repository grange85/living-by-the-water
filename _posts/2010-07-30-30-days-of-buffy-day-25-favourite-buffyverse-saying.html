<div>I must admit I&#39;m not sure what a "saying" is ... I see Hazel took "saying" to mean "quote" but it doesn&#39;t say "quote" its says "saying" and I don&#39;t know what it means...
<p /> Anyway - favourite quote it is then - of course <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2010/07/30/30-days-of-buffy-day-25/">Hazel&#39;s already picked a stack of good ones</a> and I&#39;m sure with some time and patience I could too - after all it&#39;s not as if there aren&#39;t plenty - the dialogue in Buffy is often beautiful and funny and sweet and smart so I&#39;ll choose one that&#39;s only one of those...

<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding-left: 1ex;">Oh, listen to Mary Poppins. He&#39;s got his crust all stiff and upper with that nancy-boy accent. You Englishmen are always so... Bloody hell! Sodding, blimey, shagging, knickers, bollocks, oh God! I&#39;m English!<br /> </blockquote><br />
