<p>An excerpt from <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6839634.ece">Ozzy Osbourne's upcoming autobiography "I am Ozzy" was published in The Times Online</a> this week and as well as the stories of drink, drugs and small animal decapitaions he also describes playing the first Black Sabbath album to his dad...</p></p>
<blockquote><p>
I can picture him now, fiddling with his reading specs and holding the cover in front of his face. Then he opened the sleeve, went, &ldquo;Hmm&rdquo; and said: &ldquo;Are you sure they didn&rsquo;t make a mistake, son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This cross is upside down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s supposed to be like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. Well, don&rsquo;t just stand there. Put it on. Let&rsquo;s have a bit of a singalong, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the first clap of thunder, my dad flinched.</p>
<p>I grinned nervously at him.</p>
<p>Then: Bong! Bong! Bong!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son, when does . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>BLAM! Dow! Dowwwwwww!!!</p>
<p>Dooooowwwwww!!!!!</p>
<p>My poor old man turned white. I think he&rsquo;d been expecting something along the lines of Knees up Mother Brown.<br />
