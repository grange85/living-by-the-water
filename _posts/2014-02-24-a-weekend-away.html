<p>We spent a lot of this weekend on trains and buses. On Firday Adam and I headed up to Edinburgh (Hazel was already there) to visit Hazel's dad, who's poorly. I love travelling by train, although the five hour trip back down was made less enjoyable by the train being too hot. I didn't take a camera so here are a few snaps taken with my phone:</p>
