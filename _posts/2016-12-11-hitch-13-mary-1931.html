<p>
Mary is the version of <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2016/08/19/hitch-12-murder-1930/">Murder!</a> that Hitch made for the German market - we honoured this by having a copy without English subtitles - so we watched the first half in German, with French subtitles, hoping that our years of schooling and knowledge of the film would get us through the language issue.</p>
<p>Hazel then found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSTc1QE1G_c">a copy with English subs on YouTube</a> and we were able to relzx a little for the second half of the film.</p>
<p>It's Murder! which I liked, and didn't really deviate too much. I still enjoyed it but will probably knock off a mark for my own deficiencies!</p>
