<p>It was a casual observation when I<a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2011/01/09/btvs-teachers-pet-and-what-have-we-learned/"> made it in reference to Teacher's Pet</a> but now it applies in (at least) two of the first six episodes I'd like to declare it as a rule.</p></p>
<p><strong>Rules of Buffy # 1</strong>:<em> If you&rsquo;re an extremely nice minor character in Buffy then you&rsquo;re either a demon or about to die at the hands (or claws, teeth, pincers) of a demon</em>.</p></p>
<p>Farewell Principal Flutie... you will be missed</p><br />
