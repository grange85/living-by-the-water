<p>As I <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2011/01/15/btvs-the-pack-rip-principal-flutie/">mourned the demise of Principal Flutie</a> it seems only right to celebrate the arrival of the new principal.</p><br />

<p>Principal Snyder does not like kids. I adore the idea that someone can hate the very fundamental heart of their chosen career. He must so love hating kids to have worked his way up that career path. Being a headmaster is surely a job you don't fall into.</p>
<p>As someone who really didn't enjoy school I'm quite fond of the idea that the teachers were there to make life as miserable as possible for the kids and got immense pleasure from doing it.</p></p>
<blockquote><p>My predecessor, Mr. Flutie, may have gone in for all that touchy-feely relating nonsense, but he was eaten. You're in my world now. And Sunnydale has touched and felt for the last time.</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>Kids today need discipline. That's an unpopular word these days, 'discipline'. I know Principal Flutie would have said, 'Kids need understanding. Kids are human beings.' That's the kind of woolly-headed, liberal thinking that leads to being eaten.</blockquote></p>
<p>I also love how Snyder is treated to such sinister photography - <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2011/01/23/the-puppet-show/">Hazel snagged the wonderful glowing ears pic for her post</a>.</p></p>
