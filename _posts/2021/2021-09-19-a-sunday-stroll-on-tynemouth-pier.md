Astonishingly we've been living in Tynemouth for over three months and until today hadn't been out on the pier. It wasn't for want of trying, every time we tried it was closed. Wikipedia told me that the pier was "popular with Sunday strollers" - so it seemed like it might be worth trying on a Sunday.

So we finally made it out onto the pier today - and as a welcoming party the pod of dolphins that hang around the area decided to swim past.

No photos of the dolphins because it wouldn't do them justice!
