Over the last few weeks Hazel and I took our first tentative steps back into public entertainment spaces, although neither of the films drew the sort of audience that invoked social-distancing-anxiety.


**First up we saw the brilliant Summer of Soul at the Everyman in Newcastle.**

_Good points:_
 - The film (of course).
 - The seats were a sofa!
 - You could get a coffee delivered to your seat. 
 - There was probably only 9 or 10 folk (including us) in the room.

_Not so good points:_
 - Despite there being only 9 or 10 folk (including us) in the room - we still had an annoying talker!
 - We'd booked seats down the front of but they were far too close to the screen (we moved).
 - The staff coming in mid-film to solicit orders for more coffee was just plain wrong. Once a film has started that's the last you should see of anyone until it's over!

**Next it was the [Jam Jar in Whitley Bay](https://www.jamjarcinema.com/) to see the NTLive (not live) Follies**

_Good points:_
 - Sondheim!
 - We were in the front row again but thankfully these were a comfortable distance from the screen.
 - Drinks... served in glasses!
 - Decent seats - not a sofa but roomy and comfortable
 - No one tried to sell us anything mid-film!
 - There was probably only 7 or 8 folk (including us) in the room.

_Bad points_
 - Tickets were a wee bit pricey for a 4 year old NT presentation.
