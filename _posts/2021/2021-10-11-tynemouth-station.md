Tynemouth station is enormous ~ there's undoubtedly a very good historical reason for this but as a 21st century stop on the Metro it seems rather peculiar.

Arrive at the station on any weekday and you can't help but be bemused by the great emptiness under the lovely roof.

But, arrive on a Saturday or a Sunday and you're met by the overwhelming sight of that space being put to good (and very popular) use.

Now, I'm not that good with crowds at the best of times and in the age of Covid only more so - and while it's lovely to see how popular Tynemouth Market is - I have to say I prefer the station during the week... and, particularly at night!
