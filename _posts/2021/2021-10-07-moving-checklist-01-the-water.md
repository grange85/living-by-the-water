When we decided to move out of London we established a number of criteria that the place we moved to had to fulfill - this is the first of a series of posts which might help explain why we ended up in the North East of England despite having no historic or familial connection to the area.

 - London has The Thames.
 - In London we lived where the River Brent joined The Grand Union Canal.
 - My ride to work was down the canal and along the Thames.
 - Where I worked was right on the river - not quite a river view from the office but I could be on the bank in a minute or two.

The water was really important - it was where we walked and where we rode - it was where we took visitors, it was were we escaped to. We _needed_ to live near water!

Now the North East just doesn't have canals, it seems by the time Industrial Revolution kicked in up here the rail had become the industrial artery of choice. But...

 - Tyneside  has The Tyne (of course!)
 - In Tyneside where we live the Tyne joins The North Sea
 - Our walks invariably take in bit the river and the sea - and the beautiful bit where they join.
 - Currently my office does have sea views (although... I do have to crane my neck a little!)

I do miss the canal though.
