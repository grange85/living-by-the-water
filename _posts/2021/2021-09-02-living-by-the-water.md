Hazel and I moved from London to the North East of England a couple of months back and we've missed almost nothing about it (so far).

But... there is one thing. We haven't (so far) found anybody blogging about the history and culture  of the North East, and since that's what we're interested in _Living by the water_ is our attempt at filling that gap.

If there are bloggers you think we should know about please [do tell]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/)

The title of the blog (and this post) is from an Anne Briggs song and, seemed appropriate because the Tyne and the North Sea seem to be so important to the history and culture of the area.

... there's also a lovely version by The Owl Service

... and of course, because of where we are ... The Unthanks
