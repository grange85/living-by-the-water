Sometimes it's easy to forget that The Animals were more than Eric Burdon's voice or Alan Price's organ ~ I have to admit that I sort of had. So when I heard that a blue plaques was being unveiled on Hilton Valentine's childhood home I had to remind myself why I knew the name.

Now the first song most people hear by The Animals is _The House of The Rising Sun_ which means the first thing they hear by The Animals isn't Eric's voice or Alan's organ but Hilton's arepggiated chords.

This morning I bunked off work for an hour and walked 20 minutes up the road to see a lovely little ceremony to unveil a plaque to Hilton Valentine, who died earlier this year at just 77.

It was a surprisingly emotional affair with Hilton's widow giving a lovely and tearful tribute, and Ray Laidlaw of Lindisfarne reminiscing. Also one of Hiltons pre-Animals bandmates told a lovely story of them winning a basket of fruit in a battle of the bands competition and sitting on the stairs of 42 Coburg Street dividing the spoils.

Here's a [nice little report on the unveiling](https://www.itv.com/news/tyne-tees/2021-11-12/blue-plaque-tribute-for-north-shields-guitar-legend-hilton-valentine) from ITV Tyne Tees.

Here's a nice clip of Hilton for his last song River Tyne, with some nice shots of and on Tynemouth Pier.
