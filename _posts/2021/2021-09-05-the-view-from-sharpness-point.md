When I started a new job back in 2013, to reach my new workplace I had to cycle over Kew Bridge every day - and every day I'd stop half-way accross and [take a picture downstream](https://photos.app.goo.gl/WLZUpEz7W5GbPonv9) - to be honest it wasn't that thrilling - sure, the seasons and the weather changed, and the tide came in and out, but mostly it was just the river.

When we moved to Tynemouth I had the opportunity to pick a new spot and Sharpness Point, with it's view over Longsands to Cullercoats seemed like the smartest choice... although the coast is so thrilling I could pretty much have pointed my phone at anything and found something captivating. OK, the seasons and weather will change, and the tide will come in and out, but ...

The [album of photos can be found here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/yjWodGEmWngm17jX6), and I'll keep adding to it until I get bored, or I'm no longer within reach of Sharpness Point.

Today Sharpness point is a patch of green with park benches in 1897 it had a "Band Stand"

... and in [1921 it had a first world war tank](https://www.iwm.org.uk/memorials/item/memorial/34482) - I haven't yet found a picture from my cursory scout round the usual suspects - if anyone has one I'd love to see it!
