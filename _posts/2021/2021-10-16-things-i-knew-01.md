To be honest I didn't really know a great deal about the North East before we moved here... but, I did know that [The Tygers of Pan Tang](https://www.tygersofpantang.com/) were from Whitley Bay - I'm not sure why that was important, but it seemed to be. To be honest I knew The Tygers were from Whitley Bay long, long before I had a clue where Whitley Bay was!

But that knowledge was embedded in my head and lived there long after I'd left NWOBHM behind and gone all indie!

_not that I ever really got NWOBHM out of my system - so boys, when you play a hometown gig ... I'll be there!_
