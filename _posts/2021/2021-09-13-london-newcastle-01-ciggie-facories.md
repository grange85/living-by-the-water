We cycled past the [Wills cigarette factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wills_Building) in Newcastle. It's a rather handsome, if a little ... plain, 1930s (although apparently 1940s!?) art-deco factory.

Maybe it wouldn't be plain except it's sharing a post with the frankly bonkers [Carreras cigarette factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carreras_Cigarette_Factory) in Camden, London.

Neither of them are producing ciggies any more. Wills is a bunch of homes and Carreras is a bunch of offices.
