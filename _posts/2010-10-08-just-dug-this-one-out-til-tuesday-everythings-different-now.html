<div>I love <a href="http://www.aimeemann.com/" target="_blank">Aimee Mann</a>, I don&#39;t listen to her too much, I find a little goes a long way but I love her all the same. I love her rich voice, and that she&#39;s funny and clever and potty-mouthed - but I&#39;ve never listened to anything this early in her career... partly because I just didn&#39;t feel a need and partly because there&#39;s a nagging worry that I know that it&#39;s going to have <i>the sound</i> that damaged a lot of the more mainstream late 80s pop... that "shine" and "twang".
<p />
<div style="text-align: center;"> <br /> </div> <br />A first listen through of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Til_Tuesday" target="_blank">&#39;Til Tuesday</a>&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything%27s_Different_Now" target="_blank">Everything&#39;s Different Now</a> and my fears are pretty much affirmed - there&#39;s a little&nbsp; too much production and arrangement, too much polish and too many instruments throw into the pot. I find myself listening to that more than the songs... which is a shame because the songs are mostly pretty good.
<p /> Only mostly mind. This was described as being "the first Aimee Mann solo album" and I do get that with some songs but "(Believed You Were) Lucky" and "Long Gone Buddy" sound just wrong. Hearing Aimee&#39;s voice singing on a couple of these tracks is actually a little distressing.
<p /> But there are some real gems here "Limits to Love" is great. The awful backing vocals on "The Other End (of The Telescope)" manage to not ruin it completely - probably because of the strength of the lyric (can&#39;t not love a miserable/bitter lyric)...
<p />
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding-left: 1ex;">And in time, I could only believe in one thing<br />The sky was just phosphorous stars hung on strings<br /> And you swore that they&#39;d always be mine<br />When you can pull them down anytime<br /></blockquote><br />All in, I quite enjoyed this dip into Aimee&#39;s past but am likely to call on The Forgotten Arm or Bachelor No. 2 or Live at St. Ann&#39;s Warehouse when I need a fix...
