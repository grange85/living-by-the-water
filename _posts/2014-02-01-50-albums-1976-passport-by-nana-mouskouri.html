  English language tracks with Nana's outstanding voice and some beautiful (and sometimes
  syrupy or cheesy) arrangements. The songs are mostly wise choices although Seasons

  to the point where I felt more attachment to her version of Bridge Over Troubled
  Water than to Simon & Garfunkel's.\r\nhttp://youtu.be/W91FSASEJlU\r\n"

<p>I know that first photo wasn't of the correct album sleeve but it was too awesome a photo to be relegated to second place! Here is Passport...<br />

<p>Here's a Nancy and Lee song I remember my mum loving (although the memories of this one are mixed in with memories of what I believe were a difficult time for my parents)<br />
{% aavid "udhAqeG-na0" "" %}
<p>My mum was a fan of music and classic film, which gave us an anchor during the difficult period of my growing up, we always had things we were able to talk about.</p>
<p>By the way, I learnt, while putting this post together that "Nana Mouskouri" is another one of those people who have become an "image" as much as a person. So, an image search for "Nana Mouskouri" will bring up a significant number of pictures of people with long hair and bold glasses who aren't in fact Nana. </p>
<p>The most notable other example is "Lemmy" - a search on Flickr for "Lemmy" will bring up...<br />
1/3rd pictures of Lemmy<br />
1/3rd pictures of people dressed as (or who look like) Lemmy<br />
1/3rd <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=lemmy%20cat">pictures of cats</a>!?</p>
