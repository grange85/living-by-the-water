<p>I love this album and yet for some reason I've pretty much ignored all their subsequent work. For no other reason than I just didn't get around to it. I saw Interpol at The Scala around this time, it was a good if not great show. Maybe if it had been great I wouldn't have let them go so easily. Listening to Antics now.</p><br />

<p>I think I instantly liked The Greatest better but almost never go back to it. I have to admit that I have found her more recent stuff pretty close to unbearable. </p></p>
