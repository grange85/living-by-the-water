<p>Kristin Hersh has posted her <a href="http://www.throwingmusic.com/blog/2007/08/thoughts-on-sustainability.html">Thoughts On Sustainability</a> to her blog and it makes reassuring reading...the future of an industry where the labels don't control the artist may be a little way off but seeing someone of the profile of Kristin seriously considering a business model that involves "relying on listeners, treating music as a cooperative" gives me hope that ultimately the listener (fan!) and the artist will find ways of doing business without the corporations sucking the life (and the money) out of music.</p>
<blockquote><p>To that end, I think I need to engage in a grassroots kind of capitalism, choosing principles over profits, values over image, ideals over marketing. I have to create a permeable membrane between artist and listener -- Im a craftsperson, after all. The church of the rock star that the music industry televangelists hawk has always been anathema to me anyway. This is about songs and sounds, nothing else.</blockquote></p>
