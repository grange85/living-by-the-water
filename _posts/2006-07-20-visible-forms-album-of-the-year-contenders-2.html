<p><a href="http://blog.fullofwishes.co.uk/swirling/2005/12/07/stereo-test-kit-records/">Late last year</a> I came across an absolute gem in <a href="http://www.audrey.se">Audrey</a>'s first EP and the prospect of the band producing an album matching or even surpassing that release seemed a bit of a tall order. <a href="http://tenderversion.com/artists.php">Visible Forms</a> manages to not disappoint. It is slow and gentle and melancholic and penetrating and leaves me breathless. It'll take sometrhing special to top this for album of the year...</p>
