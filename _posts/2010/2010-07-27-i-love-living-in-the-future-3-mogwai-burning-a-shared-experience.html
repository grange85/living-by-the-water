<div>I love living in the future - I&#39;ve just watched the new <a href="http://www.mogwai.co.uk">Mogwai</a> film streamed live over the Internet and watched it with 2000 other people... reading what they thought on Twitter and saying what I thought.
<p /> The stream struggled with the images and the sound will be better at some point - but the experience was lovely... and the film will be worth seeing properly with the sound turned up really really loud soon.
<p />
