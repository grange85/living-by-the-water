<div style="text-align: left;">This morning I decided to spend as much of the day as possible listening to classic punk albums. Punk for me was a slightly peripheral thing. I was a headbanger but very much from the punk side of metal so The Clash, The Pistols and most crucially The Damned were an important part of the late 70s and early 80s.<br /> </div><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damned,_Damned,_Damned">The Damned - Damned Damned Damned</a><br />It&#39;s easy to forget just how great this album is... I&#39;d be tempted to say the greatest punk album but we&#39;ll see how things progress. I kept buying Damned albums and singles right through my metal period and while they got a bit laughable and panto they were still the one punk band that I could forgive just by listening to Neat Neat Neat.
<p /> There cover of The Stooges I Feel Alright is one of the best album endings ever. And next time I do a list of favourite cover versions it&#39;ll have to be on that list.
