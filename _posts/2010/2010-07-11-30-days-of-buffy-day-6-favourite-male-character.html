<div>Not as easy for me as it was <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2010/07/10/30-days-of-buffy-day-6/">for Haze</a>l.
<p />When discussing this the other day with Hazel I said it was obviously going to be Giles and I even started to write this post with Giles in the top spot... but you know what - it&#39;s Oz, of course it&#39;s Oz - I wish he&#39;d been around longer so I could have loved him some more...
<p /> <i>Favourite Male Character: Oz</i> - and here&#39;s a picture of why...<i><br /></i><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/431259455/in/photostream/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/149/431259455_e60d28cd2f.jpg" border="0" height="281" width="500" /></a><br /> <i><br /></i>... and this is how cool he is in my head (with the help of Photoshop)
