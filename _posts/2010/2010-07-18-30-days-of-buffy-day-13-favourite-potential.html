<div>As potentials go from forgettable to <a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Molly">annoying</a> it&#39;s not too tough to choose a favourite... I was tempted to pick <a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Violet">Vi</a> because... you know... it&#39;s <a href="http://feliciaday.com/">Felicia Day</a> and that&#39;s almost reason enough... but not quite. My choice is <a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Amanda_%28Slayer%29">Amanda</a>, for her lovely long face and for "that&#39;s what I did. I stuck up for myself. The other day after class, I jumped him in the parking lot, and I slammed his stupid-ass insecure face right into the pavement!"
