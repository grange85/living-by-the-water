<p><strong>Artists of the noughts</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lfletcher/245146426/"><img alt="" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/82/245146426_f976f9a4cf.jpg" title="Kristin Hersh" class="aligncenter" width="500" height="334" /></a></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.kristinhersh.com/">Kristin Hersh</a></strong> - For more than just the music she made - for being the person she is and for painting a future that I can believe in.</p></p>
<p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/ninanastasia">Nina Nastasia</a> - Never disappointing on record and one show that I will rate amongst my most memorable. If pushed You Follow Me might be my album of the decade.</p></p>
<p><a href="http://theclientele.co.uk">The Clientele</a> - Probably the band I've seen most over the decade, and not disappointed, not even once... and a run of perfect albums over that time too.</p></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk">Damon & Naomi, Luna, Dean & Britta</a> - I consider myself very lucky that in Galaxie 500's demise I was gifted with three acts I adore and the chance to be friends with some of the nicest people.</p></p>
<p><a href="http://www.dragcity.com/artists/joanna-newsom">Joanna Newsom</a> - Two stunning albums, one great (and one fairtly good) performance. Ys could have been album of the decade but I'm now unable to put it into lists or charts - it can't be found next to anything else.</p></p>
<p>Honourable mention to <a href="http://www.ballboymusic.com">Ballboy</a>, <a href="http://www.yolatengo.com/">Yo La Tengo</a>, <a href="http://www.decemberists.com/">The Decemberists</a></p></p>
<p><strong>Albums of '09</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/frf_kmeron/4026256315/"><img alt="" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3159/4026256315_54cf32bdc6.jpg" title="The Xx" class="aligncenter" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://thexx.info/">The Xx</a> - The snob in me is bothered by just how popular The Xx have become. But I still keep listening to the album and it really is quite excellent.</p></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thepainsofbeingpureatheart.com/">The Pains of Being Pure at Heart</a> - This year has been sprinkled liberally with nostalgia - whether it has been me dipping into my metal past with Sabbath and Hawkwind, or spending time with Lush, Pale Saints, Bleach and Drugstore - the late 80s and early 90s nostalgia was fueled by The Pains...</p></p>
<p><a href="http://www.plexifilm.com/title.php?id=36">13 Most Beautiful...</a> - The DVD is good but I've mostly listened to 13 Most Beautiful as an album, having ripped the audio from the DVD. It works beyond the films.</p></p>
<p>There were plenty of others too... <a href="http://www.juliedoiron.com/">Julie Doiron</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/chevalsombre">Cheval Sombre</a>, <a href="http://theclientele.co.uk/">The Clientele</a>, <a href="http://wyeoakmusic.com">Wye Oak</a>, <a href="http://www.sviib.com/">School of Seven Bells</a> etc.</p></p>
<p><strong>Gigs of '09</strong><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/3704686774/in/set-72157621177391926/"><img alt="" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3505/3704686774_c5235a0ffd.jpg" title="13 Most Beautiful" class="aligncenter" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2009/07/09/13-most-beautiful-at-the-carnegie-hall-in-dunfermline/">13 Most Beautiful... - Carnegie Hall</a> - Not just for the show - although that was exceptional, but for the event, for the before and the after. And for Tugboat as an encore.</p></p>
<p>Damon & Naomi - <a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2009/01/16/review-damon-naomi-in-london-2/">The Luminaire</a>/<a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2009/09/05/review-damon-naomi-cafe-oto-london/">Cafe OTO</a> - two great shows although I had to leave the second one early so the Luminaire show takes the prize.</p></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2009/11/19/review-dean-britta-st-giles-in-the-fields-london/">Dean & Britta - St Giles</a> - More for what it was because if I think to hard there were disappointments - the venue worked better as an idea than in reality. But lovely all the same.</p></p>
<p>Most shows I went to this year were wonderful so I'll chip in honourable mention to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/sets/72157622368256859/">Julie Doiron</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/sets/72157622275148528/">Pastels/Tenniscoats</a>, The Clientele, Spiritualized</p></p>
