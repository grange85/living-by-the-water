<p>Having a <a href="http://www.teenagefanclub.com/">Teenage Fanclub</a> day today. Not sure where the urge came from but it's always a nice urge to get. I suspect this series of posts is going to fill up with bird sounds opening or closing songs. On I Don't Want Control of You (from the wonderful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_From_Northern_Britainhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_From_Northern_Britain">Songs From Northern Britain</a>) there's some nice bird song before The Fannies kick off.</p></p>
