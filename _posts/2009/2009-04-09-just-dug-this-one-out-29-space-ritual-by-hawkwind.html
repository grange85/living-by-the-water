<p>I arrived at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkwind">Hawkwind</a>, obviously, by working back from my love for Motorhead. I never loved Hawkwind in the same way, maybe it was the (very misplaced) <em>hippies</em> mess they got tangled up in, or maybe it was becuase the new albums they were releasing around then, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Attack_(album)">Sonic Attack</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Hawkwind">Church of Hawkwind</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Masques">Choose Your Masques</a>, were all actually pretty poor. I saw them at the Guildford Civic Hall three or four times duing the early 80s and the shows were a strange mix of thrilling and tedious. The last time, on the Choose Your Masques tour, my enduring memory of the show was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_surfer">Silver Surfer</a> animation projected behind them, and the dancers - the music itself is long-forgotten.</p></p>
<p>Despite all of that in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Ritual">Space Ritual</a> they produced an album that was better than any Motorhead managed. I had a double vinyl copy and I suspect that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Calvert">Calvert</a> bits diminished my appreciation of it. With vinyl you didn't have the luxury of programming out the weird arty-farty nonsense and get on with the psychedelic rock music, so I suspect that the album never got the full appreciation then than it deserved. Most likely I'd get frustrated and dig out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overkill_(album)">Overkill</a> instead; no distracting weirdness on that album. Listening now for the first time in more than 20 years, those bits no longer bother me and I can understand their importance to the album as a whole. I was able to enjoy this as the piece of art it was, rather than a collection of rock tracks. I'd forgotten, and still barely notice, that Space Ritual was a live album which is why I never chuck it out as one of my favourite live albums - it may well be the best live album ever.</p></p>
<p>To be honest I'm more than a little surprised at just how much I love Space Ritual - maybe it's a quirk of timing and that at some undetermined point in the future I'll read this back and have a what-was-I-thinking moment.</p></p>
