<p>There was a time in the early/mid 1980s after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Eddie_Clarke">Fast Eddie Clarke</a> left Motorhead and before The Pogues released <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum,_Sodomy,_and_the_Lash">Rum, Sodomy and the Lash</a> were I was lost in a frustrated grasp to find a musical place for myself. For a short time during that aimless wander through the obscure and unloved musical movements I decided that maybe 'psychobilly' could be where I settled. I went to three or four gigs at the Clarendon in Hammersmith and the energy and noise was exceptional, I saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guana_Batz">The Guana Batz</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Meteors">The Meteors</a> and a myriad of lesser (in fame and quality) bands. I sadly never got to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cramps">The Cramps</a> but they were the band that defined that music more than any other, and I suspect that if I had seen them maybe I would have taken a different course.</p>
<p>The Cramps albums got filed away and to be honest I've listened to very little since then and had pretty much forgotten that nine months or so until I read today that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux_Interior">Lux Interior</a> had passed away and I was filled with a desire to hear The Cramps (<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cramps">thanks last.fm</a>) and a regret that I never did see them live.</p></p>
