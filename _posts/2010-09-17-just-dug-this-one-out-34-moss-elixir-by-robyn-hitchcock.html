<div style="text-align: center;"> <br /></div>I&#39;ve seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robyn_Hitchcock">Robyn Hitchcock</a> quite a few times over the years - never as a headliner (<a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2007/02/09/the-end-of-the-road-for-me-and-the-decemberists/">last time with The Decemberists a couple of years back</a>); I&#39;ve listened to albums (and Soft Boys albums); I&#39;ve listened to friends express their appreciation... but for all that I find it really hard to like him, and I&#39;m not entirely sure why. I mean, it theoretically pushes all the right buttons for me but there&#39;s something that just doesn&#39;t seem right.
<p /> This is the first time I&#39;ve listened to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moss_Elixir">Moss Elixir</a> and it started well enough I loved the violin/guitar intro of "Sinister but Happy", although I found the lyrics a little discomforting, and for a while I thought this might be the time I&#39;d "get over it" (whatever "it" might be). I found "Devil&#39;s Radio" just annoying and by "Man with a Woman&#39;s Shadow", "I Am Not Me" and, particularly, "De Chirico Street" I was itching to get out.
<p /> I stuck it out though, I&#39;m glad I did "You and Oblivion" was great (sort of reminded me of Grant McLennan) and while it hasn&#39;t made me a fan I can appreciate more why people might think I ought to be a fan.
