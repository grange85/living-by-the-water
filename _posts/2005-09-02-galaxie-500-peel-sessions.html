<p>Oh man this has been such a long time coming. The only failing of the otherwise wonderful <a href="http://blog.fullofwishes.info/galaxie/index.php?album_id=12">Galaxie 500 Box Set</a> was the glaring omission of the bands two sessions recorded for the legendary BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel's radio show. Thankfully that oversight is about to be rectified as <a href="http://www.damonandnaomi.com">Damon &amp; Naomi</a>'s own record label <a href="http://20-20-20.com">20/20/20</a> is putting out a CD with the all eight tracks from the two sessions</p></p>
<p>The sessions recorded in 1989 and 1990 included a version of Sex Pistols Submission and Buffy Saint Marie's Moonshot (which Dean Wareham later recorded with Britta Phillips for their album <a href="http://blog.fullofwishes.info/galaxie/index.php?album_id=186">L'Avventura</a>).</p></p>
<p>The CD will be released on November 14th and you can <a href="http://www.damonandnaomi.com/about/g500.html">pre-order now</a> and receive a limited edition postert of the album artwork</p></p>
