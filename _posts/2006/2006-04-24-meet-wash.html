<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/133002591/">Wash</a></div><br />
This is one of our new cats <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/grange85/search/tags:wash/">"Wash"</a> - we picked him and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/grange85/search/tags:tara/">"Tara"</a> up from the RSPCA on Saturday afternoon and since then the pair of them have been holed up behind the sofa. We haven't heard a peep from either of them. They sneak out and eat/poo while we're asleep and are probably having a little party now while we're at work.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
No <em>decent</em> picture of Tara as yet as she just backs away anytime anyone comes close to her. I suspect it'll be a day or two before we see anything of either of them<br />
