<p>I'm playing a bit of catch-up withj my neglected blog - I've had the new <a href="http://camera-obscura.net/">Camera Obscura</a>  album <a href="http://blog.fullofwishes.co.uk/swirling/2006/06/14/camera-obscura/">for a month</a> and it is just lovely - it's a summer album, it twangs with country sunshine and refreshes like a summer breeze - it'll be near the top come year end when the sunshine and summer breezes will be in short supply...</p>
