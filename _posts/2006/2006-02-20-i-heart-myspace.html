<p>In the wake of my <a href="http://blog.fullofwishes.co.uk/swirling/2006/02/06/i-despise-myspace/">childish and petulant rant</a> at MySpace after <a href="http://www.damonandnaomi.com">Damon and Naomi</a> decided to sign up to the flaky social networking Leviathan I was contacted by two former members of Galaxie 500 pointing out that there was an <em>unofficial</em> and inaccurate Galaxie 500 MySpace page and they thought it would be a good idea if there was also an <em>official</em> and accurate one as well</p>
<p>As if my ego hadn't been inflated enough by a namecheck on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=aheadfullofwi-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B000228SPU%2526tag=aheadfullofwi-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B000228SPU%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82" title="View product details at Amazon">Don't Let Our Youth Go To Waste  DVD</a> they suggested that I might be the right person to look after such an undertaking. Obviously someone with any moral fibre would have been compelled to decline the offer - sadly I just crumbled under my own vanity and am therefore obliged to withdraw my previous dissing of MySpace and say that it is not a shallow, mindless and messy horror - but a lovely, flowery and friendly place to hang out.</p>
<p>So here it is the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/galaxie500official">official Galaxie 500 MySpace page</a></p></p>
