<p>...Stuart and I are in here somewhere - you have to look really hard - to be honest I haven't spotted us yet but I do remember seeing us when it was first shown so I guess the problem is that I have no idea what I looked like 15 or 16 years ago - I certainly had more hair than I do now...</p>
<p>This show slotted in at number 2 in my most recent <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/grange85/journal/2006/04/28/125360/">Top 6 shows of all time</a>. I smiled all the way through this video...</p>
