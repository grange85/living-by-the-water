<p>I had a bit of a thing for Lush in days gone by - as far as 4AD's acts of the 90s they don;t quite match up to Pale Saints - but they made the exact sort of guitar-wash with girly vocals that I'm a sucker for to this day. Which I guess makes it inevitable that I should feel obliged to (finally) check out former Lush member Emma Anderson's latest project <a href="http://www.sing-sing.co.uk/">Sing-Sing</a>.</p>
<p>I had downloaded a track a year or so back but hadn't really followed up and sort of lost touch. So last week I bought their second album  <a href="https://secure-www.areti.com/sing-sing/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=68">Sing-Sing and I</a> and am thoroughlky enjoying it. There's a sort of guilty pleasure in listening to something that sounds so grounded in 90s indie.</p></p>
