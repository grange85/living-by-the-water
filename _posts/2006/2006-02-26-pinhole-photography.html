<p>I've been having on and off fun lately making <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/104364716/">pinhole</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/104346159/">cameras</a> out of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/12501119/">bits of rubbish</a>. They're not quite in the league of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wolkerstorfer/sets/178304/">photographers</a> that <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/heyoka/sets/1830434/">make me gasp</a> - but there is something very satisfying in making a photograph using a cardboard box.</p>
<p>After Saturday's piano lessons Adam and I wandered off to the nearby Hoover Factory - an Art Deco glory in west London and tried to take some pinhole pictures - this one is all we got from the day because long exposures, gale-force winds and cardboard boxes don't make pinholery easy.</p>
<p>Today I rebuilt my coffee tin camera because it might cope better in the wind...</p>
