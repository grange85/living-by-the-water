<p>As much as I hate the way that the <a href="http://blog.fullofwishes.co.uk/swirling/2006/03/17/is-there-no-end-to-the-desire-to-be-a-part-of-something-bigger/">big companies want to own the whole of the Internet</a> I seem to have become some sort of Google apologist. It seems that they can do so little wrong (although the Google China censorship is a little disappointing). I love Google Mail, I love that they have made Internet advertising less intrusive and ugly, I love Google Maps and Google Earth and now I adore <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/04/its-about-time.html">Google Calendar</a> - I've been waiting for this one for a while in the knowledge that they WILL do it and they WILL do it better than anyone else has managed an online calendar.</p>
<p>I love Google - I just hate the way they make me a hypocrite!</p>
