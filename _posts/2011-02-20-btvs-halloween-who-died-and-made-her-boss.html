<p>Halloween might be the second great Buffy episode and Willow is most certainly the boss of this one. Whether it's her beautiful command of the situation, or just how wonderfully she embraces being a ghost... she doesn't even think twice about walking through walls.</p>

<p>There is a lot to love about Halloween: Cordy's like a great big cat, Buffy faints. The only downside is the ridiculous costume that Buffy bullies Willow into wearing... you look silly and you were right to reach for the sheet!</p>
<p>I feel that we're entering a Buffy golden patch and that looks like it might coincide with a Willow golden patch... and just maybe the two are related.</p>
