<p>Walking around Whitechapel this afternoon we came across this plaque commemorating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_of_Cable_Street">The Battle of Cable Street</a> (1936)<br />
<a href="http://www.ipernity.com/doc/grange85/30100551"><img class="aligncenter" title="They shall not pass" alt="They shall not pass" src="http://u1.ipernity.com/40/05/51/30100551.6530ca4f.640.jpg?r1" height="426" width="640" /></a><br />
Which means I get to do a post with The Men They Couldn't Hang for the <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2014/01/28/one-shot-and-the-band-played-waltzing-matilda/" title="One shot: And The Band Played Waltzing Matilda">second time in a week</a>...<br />
