<p>Surprise! Being exposed to more music makes you more likely to buy more music...</p></p>
<blockquote><p>However, our analysis of the Canadian P2P file-sharing subpopulation suggests that there is a strong positive relationship between P2P file-sharing and CD purchasing. That is, among Canadians actually engaged in it, P2P file-sharing increases CD purchasing.<br/><em><a href="http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/ippd-dppi.nsf/en/ip01462e.html">Intellectual Property Policy Directorate - The Impact of Music Downloads and P2P File-Sharing: Summary of findings</a></em></blockquote></p>
