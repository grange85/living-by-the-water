<p>I finished the awesome <a href="http://orange.half-life2.com/portal.html">Portal</a> last night and am still laughing at the ending. I've listened to almost nothing but "Still Alive" since I finished it; I've <a href="http://www.topazstorm.com/?sheetmusic">downloaded sheet music</a>; I've watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lo6uXwi4M0">loads</a> of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxNmeMklFk8">great</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQrSYLYtltU">videos</a> on YouTube; I've downloaded the <a href="http://orange.half-life2.com/images/portalwallpaper/PortalWallpaper.zip">official wallpaper pack</a> and put one on my desktop. I can't remember being quite so taken with a game before - it's a short but insanely sweet cake of a game.</p>
<p>The review on <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/?p=397">Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a> pretty much says all I wanted to say about it in a clever, more rational and more articulate way.</p><br />
<blockquote>It&rsquo;s easy to be disappointed by Portal&rsquo;s brevity. Just when you&rsquo;re feeling like the master of the tool, it&rsquo;s over. While the story is complete, and the ending is the funniest gaming moment in many years, there&rsquo;s no denying you&rsquo;re left still hungry. It gives you a bite of a delicious cake, but then doesn&rsquo;t let you gorge until stuffed. Fortunately there&rsquo;s more to do once the main game is over. Six of the rooms can be replayed on a significantly higher difficulty level, and there are specific challenges for the regular levels, completing them either in a limited number of footsteps, a restricted number of portals, or a rigid time limit. These offer a terrifying challenge, with Bronze awards in reach, but Silver and certainly Gold seeming madly impossible. At first.</blockquote><object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/RthZgszykLs&hl=en"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/RthZgszykLs&hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object>
