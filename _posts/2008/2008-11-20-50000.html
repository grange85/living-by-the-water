<p>I had decided that my 50,000th track played <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/grange85">on last.fm</a> would be carefully chosen and played (just for myself obviously) with a little bit of a celebration. Today I noticed that the Billy Bragg track I was playing was number 50,027 and that the time for celebration had passed. Counting backwards it appears that it passed last night just before I went to bed when I played the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Low/_/Santa%27s+Coming+Over">new Low xmas single Santa's Coming Over</a>, that I'd nabbed from some blog somewhere...it wasn't very good, far too harsh and lacking in melody, not sweet like most of their very wonderful Christmas EP from a few years back.</p></p>
<p>Oh well - maybe I'll be more on the ball when I hit 100000.</p></p>
