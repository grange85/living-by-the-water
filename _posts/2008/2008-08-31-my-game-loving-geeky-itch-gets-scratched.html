<p>I have previously <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2008/04/14/keep-on-trying-til-you-run-out-of-cake/">sung the praises of the awesome game Portal</a> and it's rather wonderful closing sequence, which I still smile about whenever I think of it...I haven't previously expressed how much I thoroughly enjoyed <a href="http://feliciaday.com/">Felicia Day</a>'s geeky comendy <a href="http://www.watchtheguild.com/">The Guild</a> or how chuffed I was that <a href="http://www.dynamicforces.com/htmlfiles/interviews.html?showinterview=IN04040885031">she mentioned The Clientele in an interview</a> a while back. So...Felicia Day performing the Portal closing song with the writer Jonathan Coulton is the stuff dreams are made of - fortunately it was performed at a <a href="http://www.pennyarcadeexpo.com/index.php">the sort of place</a> so packed with geeks that there are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22felicia+day%22+%22still+alive%22&search_type=&aq=f">stacks of videos on YouTube</a> (and no doubt some were there within minutes of the performance)...this is (so far) the best of them...</p><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/XfyeJ6CX0vI&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/XfyeJ6CX0vI&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></p>
