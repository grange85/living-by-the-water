<p>The last time <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2007/06/22/you-like-the-shoes-i-wear-12-dean-wareham/">Dean appeared in this series</a> I rushed off to the Puma website to try  and buy his shoes (now that's the dedication of a fan). I do rather like these white shoes but they are white and I don't think I can pull that off ( I don't think many people can pull off white footwear!)</p>
<p>So this time I'm not as inspired to walk in the shoes of my hero. </p>
<p>To be honest I do have a problem with Dean and his white things - I'm not that keen on seeing him <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/quadb/2253632225/">holding a white guitar</a> and as for the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/chelew/74932316/">white jeans he wears far too often</a> (shudder)...</p>
<p>#18 Dean Wareham of <a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com">Dean & Britta</a> and his white sneakers.</p><br />
