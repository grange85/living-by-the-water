<p>Obviously <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2008/04/08/so-where-is-the-young-lady-who-im-supposed-to-takedown-town/">that last post</a> was the very pinnacle of uncool so in attempt to restore my damaged credibility...<br />

What's not to love about this video - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_Happening">Beat Happening</a> set up in the street and life goes on around them...kids wandering around...traffic drifting past...customers wandering in front of the camera...all oblivious to the fact that they were a crucial part of making this the very best video that will ever be on YouTube.</p>
