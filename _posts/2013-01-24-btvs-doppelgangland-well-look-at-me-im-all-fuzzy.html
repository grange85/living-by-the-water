<p>We're not allowed to watch the next episode until I've blogged about this one and Hazel's getting impatient. It ought to be easy because I love Doppelgangland, and who doesn't, but it's easier to write half-arsed blog posts about episodes you don't like... an episode you love deserves more. Sadly this one won't get more. Just assume this is a beautiful and eloquent post about one of my top 5 Buffy episodes!</p>
<p>In reality it'll be a couple of quotes and a screengrab and a music video that is vaguely related (I have no idea what yet so it may be totally unrelated!)<br />

Well, other bands know more than three chords. Your professional bands can play up to six, sometimes seven completely different chords.</p>
<p>That's just, like, fruity jazz bands.<br />

<p>Soft Machine isn't fruity jazz and I've no idea about chords but there's a lot going on...<br />

<p>So many posts turn into gratuitous Willow love but I just did a post about a Willow episode and didn't mention Willow... until now</p>
