Low - The Great Destroyer</p>
<p>Ahhh "Slowcore" - the pigeonhole that was made for me.<br />
<a href="http://www.chairkickers.com">Low</a>'s new album is out now (or soon) and hammers<br />
another nail in the coffin of this once great musical<br />
(non) "movement". OK that's a little bit dramatic but<br />
what is with Low seeming to think that being on Sub<br />
Pop obliges them to put out a neo-Grunge piece? And<br />
how are they getting away with it? "Just Stand Back"<br />
is probably the worst song ever put out by a band I<br />
once loved - I mean so really REALLY dull it makes me<br />
want to cry. I never thought I wouldn't buy a Low<br />
album (hell I still buy Stereolab albums), but I don't<br />
think I'll buy The Great Destroyer because Low don't<br />
make music I love any more. Shame.</p>
<p>As a mark of respect today I am listening to <a href="http://www.subpop.com/bands/codeine/codeine.html">Codeine</a>.</div></p>
