<p>Twice during Tuesday night's show at The Metro I started to video a Dean & Britta performance and twice I thought "bollocks" and put my camera away - it was too much of a treat to ruin my enjoyment by standing still and holding my camera as carefully as possible. So you never got videos of Bonnie & Clyde or Ceremony</p></p>
<p>Luckily YouTube comes up trumps, OK it's not from London and it is of a song that they didn't even manage to do in London! But here's a great video of Dean & Britta doing Chinatown in <del datetime="2007-06-24T22:39:57+00:00">Barcelona</del> <ins datetime="2007-06-24T22:39:57+00:00">Madrid</ins> a couple of weeks back...</p><br />

<p>And that's it for Dean & Britta week - normal levels of (in)activity will be resumed next week.</p></p>
