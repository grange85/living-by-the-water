<p>I love Kristin Hersh's new(ish) album <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000JJRXGG%26tag=aheadfullofwi-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000JJRXGG%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82" title="View product details at Amazon">Learn to Sing Like a Star</a>, but I think I may love her blog posts more than her music - they always make me laugh so much...</p>
<blockquote><p>Billy swears into the mic in front of the freezing children and then looks ill. He tries to apologize and somehow swears again in the apology. He shoots me a distressed look.</p>
<p>"Harder than it looks, isn't it?" I say.</p>
<p>"Hell, yeah..." he covers the mic with his hand. "Is 'hell' a swear?"</blockquote><br />
