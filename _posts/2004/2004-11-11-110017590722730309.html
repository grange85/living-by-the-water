Oh hell...they make such lovely sounds; they have such fun/sad/funny/miserable lyrics; they have song titles nearly as long as the song itself; and if they keep chucking out albums as good as the "Royal Theatre" then maybe I guess I'll have nothing to complain about.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.slrecords.net/">SL Records</a> have an <a href="http://www.slrecords.net/music_downloads/artofkissing.mp3">mp3 of The Art of Kissing</a> to tryout - and you can <a href="http://www.slrecords.net/shop.htm">buy the album direct from them</a> for a very reasonable tenner...you'd be stupud not to.</p>
