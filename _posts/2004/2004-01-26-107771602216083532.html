<p><strong>Everytime I've bought a Stereolab album since "Dots and Loops" I'd vowed it would be my last</strong> - but somehow I keep buying them. They have a new album out and I'll probably buy it.</p>
<p>I think I may be coming to terms with my Stereolab "problem" - Sound Dust was a bad album - I listened to it a couple of times and even relative to the other late 'lab releases it was IMO pretty poor - but it did put the rest of their releases into some sort of perspective.</p>
<p>I think the "problem" stems for the visions of great things that I saw for Stereolab and they failed to deliever - in fact they failed to deliver in such a sensational way - how could Spiritualized sell out the Albert Hall and Stereolab waste away sadly on the fringes - I have a lot of time for Jason Spaceman and his pompous expulsions, but even the potential of Laser Guided Melodies was cast in the shadows of what "Transient Random Noise Bursts..." promised.</p>
<p>Maybe it's heading up to 40 that has compelled me to re-appraise the Stereolab "lounge years" - maybe it's that I've been learning to play piano for six months now and am learning to appreciate msuic on another plane - maybe it's because I can't stand to be mad at them any more...</p>
