<p><a title="McCarthy - Banking, Violence and the Inner Life Today" href="http://www.last.fm/music/McCarthy/Banking%2C+Violence+and+the+Inner+Life+Today" class="bbcode_album">Banking, Violence and the Inner Life Today</a> - <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/McCarthy" class="bbcode_artist">McCarthy</a><br /><br />
<br /><br />
My fondness for McCarthy was partly founded in their politics - at a time when Thatcher and her Tory party seemed hell bent on destroying all that I believed in,  I was excited to find anyone who railed against them - and McCarthy railed...I vaguely remember them dissing <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Bragg" class="bbcode_artist">Billy Bragg</a> in an interview for being too right wing. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
But beyond their politics they made just the sort of guitar pop that I loved then (and still pretty much love now). Their last album really does seem to be the end of the road though - not because it's bad (it's very good). But more because it seemed that McCarthy (like Thatcher) was a thing of the 80s (Thathcer was ousted within six months of the release of this album).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Let's look at the evidence...<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>It included a prominent role for <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Laetitia+Sadier" class="bbcode_artist">Laetitia Sadier</a> whose credits up until this point where for translating McCarthy lyrics into French. Laetitia and <span title="Unknown artist" class="bbcode_unknown">Tim Gane</span> of course went on to form <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Stereolab" class="bbcode_artist">Stereolab</a>.</li>
<li>It included a shameless (and utterly brilliant) attempt to jump on the baggy bandwagon (<a title="McCarthy - Get a Knife Between Your Teeth" href="http://www.last.fm/music/McCarthy/_/Get+a+Knife+Between+Your+Teeth" class="bbcode_track">Get a Knife Between Your Teeth</a>).</li>
<li>It was shinier, more <em>produced</em> than their previous efforts.</li></ul>I saw what was (possibly) their penultimate performance at ULU supporting <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Chills" class="bbcode_artist">The Chills</a>, they were plagued by poor sound but I still remember it fondly. I love Stereolab and for a while it seemed that <span title="Unknown artist" class="bbcode_unknown">Malcolm Eden</span>'s <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Herzfeld" class="bbcode_artist">Herzfeld</a> would also help fill the hole that McCarthy left.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If pushed I'd probably say I prefer <a title="McCarthy - I Am a Wallet" href="http://www.last.fm/music/McCarthy/I+Am+a+Wallet" class="bbcode_album">I Am a Wallet</a> - but I definitely listen to this one more.<br /><br />
<br /></p>
