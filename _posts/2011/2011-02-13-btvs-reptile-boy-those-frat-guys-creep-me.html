<p>Reptile boy is all about the utter mystery that is the "fraternity" and the "frat boy" - over the years my complete understanding and knowledge of the "frat boy" is as follows</p></p>
<ul>
<li>They are spoilt rich kids...</li>
<li>... who nobody likes...</li>
<li>... who tended to get blamed for being annoyingly drunk and loud at Luna concerts</li></ul></p>
<p>And of course there is this...</p><br />

<p>I haven't seen Animal House for 30 years... and really don't want to - I used to like it but am fairly certain that I'd really, <em>really</em> hate it.</p>
<p>Not much to say about Reptile Boy though... although Giles playing at being the slayer when no one was watching made me smile...</p><br />
