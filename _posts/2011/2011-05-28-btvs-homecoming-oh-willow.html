<p>Oh, oh, oh Willow... there's Oz - he's insanely cool, he's cute and he's a werewolf... and there's Xander... he's a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pillock">pillock</a> - you may be really clever but right now... you're not very bright...</p>
<p>Meanwhile... there's Cordy who can fight demons with just a spatula and her tongue! She's awesome!</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Cordy:</strong> I hear you, you redneck moron. You got a dress that goes with that hat?<br />
<strong>Lyle: </strong> I'm gonna...<br />
<strong>Cordelia: </strong> Rip out my innards, play with my eyeballs, boil my brain and eat it for brunch? Listen up, needle-brain. Buffy and I have taken out four of your cronies, not to mention your girlfriend.<br />
<strong>Lyle: </strong> WIFE!<br />
<strong>Cordelia: </strong> Whatever. The point is, I haven't even broken a sweat. See, in the end, Buffy's just the runner-up. <em>I'm</em> the Queen. You get me mad what do you think I'm gonna do to you?</blockquote></p>
