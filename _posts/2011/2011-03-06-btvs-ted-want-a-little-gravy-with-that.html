<p>I don't tend to obsess about Buffy quite the way that Hazel does, so I only get to hear about which episodes other folk do or don't enjoy based on what she says... and apparently Ted is not a particularly popular episode. While I'll accept it's not a classic in Ted himself they have an absolute gem of a villain and he's played quite hilariously by John Ritter.</p></p>
