<figure><img src="http://media.grange85.co.uk/swirling/uploads/2011/08/Back_in_the_DHSS.jpg" alt="" title="Back_in_the_DHSS" width="240" height="240" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1498" /><figcaption>I bought <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_in_the_DHSS">Back in the DHSS</a> in 1985, when it came out, because everyone said I should... I listened to it a bit, then filed it away and then spent a lot of the subsequent years trying to pretend I'd never heard it. I don't get why I was supposed to like it and I don't get why so many people do.</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_Man_Half_Biscuit">Half Man Half Biscuit</a> are a comedy outfit (I think it's insanely generous that their Wikipedia article describes them as satirical) and as such hold very little interest to me, I don't mind laughing - and I don't even mind laughing at song lyrics, but I prefer my humour to be a part of the song, not all there is of it. HMHB's humour is front and centre and pretty much revolves around throwing out pop-culture references and... well that's about it.</p>
<p>If they can get a laugh purely out of mentioning Una Stubbs or Stevie Nicks, Bob Todd or Dairylea triangles then that's all they need to do - or perhaps make tiresome references to the TV of their born-in-the-60s audience and that's pretty much HMHB. "Oh yes [snigger] we'll sing about Camberwick Green and mention drugs... and swear a bit - that'll be funny because all those people who watched it back then are probably smoking dope now... and swearing [giggle]".</p>
<p>They are just the indie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Barron_Knights">Barron Knights</a> and I find it remarkable that they've managed to carve a 30+ year career out of it... but then <a href="http://www.barronknights.com/">The Barron Knights are still working</a> so I perhaps shouldn't really be surprised.</p>
<p>I listened to this with a fair amount of skipping because it really was unbearable, juvenile nonsense.</p>
