<p>Prophecy Girl is the first genuinely exceptional Buffy episode. There were some gems in season one (I was surprised to hear that apparently it doesn't get the love it deserves) but Prophecy Girl is when it grows up... when it lays the foundation for the next 6 years.</p></p>
<p>Here are 5 reasons why...</p></p>
<ul>
<li>Cordy drives to the library</li>
<li>"When he wakes up tell him... I don't know. Think of something cool, tell him I said it"</li>
<li>"I may be dead, but I'm still pretty. Which is more than I can say for you" </li>
<li>"The part that gets me, though, is where Buffy is the Vampire Slayer. She's so... little"</li></ul></p>
<p>... but above all else...</p></p>
<ul>
<li>The "I quit" sequence is stunning and heartbreaking - Sarah Michelle Gellar completely nails it... if a TV show with a title like this one can reduce a 46 year old man to tears in its first season then clearly it is something very special...</li></ul><br />
