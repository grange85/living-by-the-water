<p>It's beginning to seem as if there are actually no bad episodes of Buffy, just ones that aren't as good as others, or ones that take a little cooking before they taste good. <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2011/01/09/btvs-teachers-pet-and-what-have-we-learned/">Teacher's Pet</a>, wasn't so bad, on second viewing Beer Bad went from rubbish to right up there with the best (well maybe not that good - but I thoroughly enjoyed it second time)... and Bad Eggs was perfectly enjoyable and had another of those beautiful Buffy gems that make it impossible to do anything but love this show...</p></p>

<p><em>Actually there are some <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2011/02/03/btvs-some-assembly-required-frankenstein/">pretty poor episodes</a> but the ones that are supposed to be bad haven't been nearly as bad as I supposed they would be...</em></p></p>
