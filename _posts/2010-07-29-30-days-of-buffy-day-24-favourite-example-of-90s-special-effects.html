<div>Maybe I&#39;m the perfect Buffy watcher - too engrossed in the story and characters to even notice the SFX - good or bad. Maybe the mayor going all snaky was a bit rubbish but not enough for me to be bothered but it ... and to be honest I had more of an issue with make-up and prosthetics (erm... shark head!) - so I think I may have to pass on this one too...
<p /> Sorry.
