So Everything's Swirling gets a long overdue overhaul - and a new URL (feel free to update your bookmarks, blogrolls and RSS feeds - although the old ones will probably keep working)<br /><br />

Hazel's blog <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk">Let's Fold Scarves</a> has also had a refit and is whipping my sorry arse in the who's-blog-is-more-popular competition...if, of course, we cared about anything as trite as popularity. Just like with music - the more obscure the better!<br />
