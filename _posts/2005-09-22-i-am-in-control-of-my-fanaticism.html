<p>Stylus has a truly disturbing piece on <a href="http://www.stylusmagazine.com/feature.php?ID=1418">music fan fiction</a> - which rather makes a sham of me calling myself a "fan" of anything because I don't recall ever having gone so far as <i>writing</i> fantasy pieces involving the members of <a href="http://blog.fullofwishes.info">Galaxie 500</a>.</p></p>
