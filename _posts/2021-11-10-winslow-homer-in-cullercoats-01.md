Before we moved to the North East we took a few trips up here and each time I'd post a pic of the beach at Cullercoats, and each time my pal Andrew would mention Winslow Homer, and each time I'd have to Google to find out who he was! I [suggest you do the same](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winslow_Homer) because this is a quick filler post not me writing a biography!

I liked what I saw, I even tried (and failed) to copy some of his art (in my own scribbly ways) - but this isn't about my half-baked attempts - this is about his!

You don't see so many fisher folk on the beach there these days - mostly swimmers, paddleboarders and dog walkers.
