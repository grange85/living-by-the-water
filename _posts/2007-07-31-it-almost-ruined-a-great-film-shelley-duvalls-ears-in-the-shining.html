<div class="imagebox-a"><img id="image267" src="http://media.grange85.co.uk/swirling/uploads/2007/07/shelley1.jpg" alt="Shelley's ears" /></div>The biggest problem I've had with this is finding a picture to illustrate just what bothers me about Shelley and her ears - because I'm sure her ears are just fine really...it's the way her ears peek through her haircut that bothers me. We get a hypnotizing and distracting glimpse of an ear every time she moves her head. I guess that sticky-out ears and straight/flat hair just don't mix (see also Joni Mitchell).</p>
<p>The Shining must be one of the scariest films ever made. Jack Nicholson overacts like he always does and just for a change it's just the sort of film in which Jack's overacting <em>can</em> work (normally Jack appearing in a film is reason enough to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096895/" title="Batman">not</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094332/" title="The Witches of Eastwick">watch</a> it - although there are of course <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071315/" title="Chinatown">exceptions</a>). Shelley too, hams it up and the film gets no worse for any of her screaming and jittering about. The kid could use a haircut but even that doesn't bother me as much as bad-haired-kids often do. I must admit that I haven't sat through the whole film for a few years. First time I saw it I was bothered more by how different it was from the book than by Shelley's ears.</p>
