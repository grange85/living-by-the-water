Oh I loved Philip Reeves Mortal Engines books - I read the original four many years ago and am only just working through the Fever Crumb trilogy. I loved the originals so much that they were the book I [took to my desert island]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2011/2011-05-24-my-desert-island-discs %}) when I picked my desert island discs back in 2011.

When the film was announced way back I felt a little apprehensive - I knew it wouldn't be as good as the book, of course not, it couldn't be. But my apprehension went a little further&hellip;

- I find CGI annoyingly inauthentic. I've written about [why I like models over CGI before]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2017/2017-03-09-hitch-17-number-seventeen-1932 %}):
> with beautiful models, nobody would have been fooled into thinking the models were real, but that's the joy of models over CGI, becuase neither look authentic ... but models *are* real and therefore give authenticity, and with authenticity comes tension.
		
- I find Peter Jackson's films to be overblown and unsubtle.
- I don't like modern super-hero films.
- Look what happened to His Dark Materials, another series of books I loved but whose first (and so far only) film was a disappointment.

But I went in with as much optimism as I could muster. But by the end I felt deflated and annoyed - there was very little to love and all the worst fears of unconvincing CGI, over-reliance on (super-hero-like) action and ridiculously unsubtle plot and script were realised. The heart had been torn out of the book.
