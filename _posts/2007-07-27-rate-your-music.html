<div class="imagebox-a"><img id="image269" src="http://media.grange85.co.uk/swirling/uploads/2007/07/ratings1.jpg" alt="Rating my music..." /></div>I've always had a problem rating my music - because pretty much everything I buy is bloody great and therefore deserves a 4.5 or a 5 out of 5 - so <a href="http://rateyourmusic.com/~grange85">Rate Your Music</a> was something I just shrugged off - I like the idea of collecting music online and using these sites to learn about more good music (it's why I love last.fm so much) but the "Rate" bit put me off for a long time. BUT I signed up anyway...</p>
<p>I still have a problem, even with a concerted effort to make full use of the five-star rating system, pretty much everything I've rated so far has fallen into the 4.0 to 5.0 range - but I'm trying harder. I like the little things about it - comparing my ratings to other users, having a map of the world with my music dotted over it. It's simple to use as long as I resist the temptation to turn it into a catalogue of my collection and instead use it as another way to find and reccommend music I'm sure I'll learn to love it.</p>
<p>In reality it, like so much of Web 2.0 it really is just about me - the person who will find my page most interesting is undoubtedly me (just like I'm the one who finds my <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/grange85/">last.fm profile</a> most interesting!)</p>
