In a post from a couple of years back about <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2007/10/03/my-top-6gigs-at-the-royal-albert-hall/" title="My Top 6…gigs at the Royal Albert Hall">gigs at The Albert Hall</a>, I posted about Cowboy Junkies...</p>
<blockquote><p>My abiding memory of this gig was the "new" percussionist getting an onstage telling off for making a noise between songs which made me sneer at the precious-ness of the band. I&rsquo;d loved The Trinity Sessions and quite enjoyed The Caution Horses but my Cowboy Junkies thing pretty much ended there - or maybe, more specifically ended at the point at which Margo turned and stared at the new boy and apologised for him.</blockquote><br />
When it was released I was quite taken with The Trinity Session but listening now it is often just a great big old yawn, maybe I've heard too much beuatiful music played and/or recorded in churches to realise that it's more than just the church-y ambience that makes it great. Maybe I've just got harsher, or harder to please.</p>
<p>I sort of hoped that the album would hint at why I loved it as much as I did, but I just can't figure it out. Maybe it was just the VU cover after all...<br />
