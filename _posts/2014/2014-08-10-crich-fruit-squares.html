One of the highlights of the Indietracks weekend for the last two years has been the opportunity to visit the lovely <a href="http://www.theloaf.co.uk/">The Loaf bakery/cafe in Crich</a> and eat their lovely Crich Fruit Squares. And for two years I've come home and tried to replicate them... and never really got close, generally ending up with something much more akin to a teacake or a hot cross bun.</p>
<p>A cheeky speculative tweet after yesterdays failure solicited some clues, now if only I could make it up there more than once a year for more tasting sessions!!<br />
