Hazel and I went to the BFI to see Mark Gatiss introduce a screening of Billy Wilder's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Private_Life_of_Sherlock_Holmes">The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes</a>. I'd not seen the film for many years, in fact I wasn't 100% sure I had seen it, and when Mark effused about it I started to wonder how I could forget such a clearly amazing film.</p>
<p>I had seen the film before, but I barely remembered it partly because it was a long time ago, and partly because, while mostly good, and often great, it wasn't quite as remarkable as Mr Gatiss suggested. Robert Stephens and Colin Blakely make a splendid Holmes and Watson, and always nice to see Christopher Lee pop up. </p>
<p>But it was a fun twisty plot that clearly had more than a little influence on Alan Moore's League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.</p>
