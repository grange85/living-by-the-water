<figure><img src="http://media.grange85.co.uk/swirling/misc/jekyll-hyde-1931-lobby-card.jpg" width="640" height="507" class="aligncenter" /><figcaption>Saw the 1931 Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde at the BFI on Friday - and while visually and technically the film is a masterpiece, I can't help but be bothered by some rather questionable flaws in the plot (the most annoying being the supposedly totally bad Hyde character seeming to behave in a good way, and the supposedly good Jekyll being rather bad). Also it is a rather unpleasant film! But Miriam Hopkins was wonderful and Fredric March, was a terrific, if a little cartoon-y Hyde.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Anyway, here are my two favourite Jekyll to Hyde transformations (and not a spot of CGI between them!):</p>
<p>1. The second transformation Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1931)</p>
