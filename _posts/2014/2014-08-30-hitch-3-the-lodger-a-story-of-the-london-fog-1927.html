... and classic Hitch really kicks in with The Lodger. The conceit is superb, the mood is as beautifully dense as the London fog, and the performances he elicits from his actors are impeccable. Throw in a blonde, a twist, some fun with the camera, and a (possibly) innocent man, and you have a recipe that the master cooks to near perfection.</p>
<p>The DVD we have (from a German box set) has a decent orchestral score, no idea where it's from.</p>

<strong>Lesson learned</strong>: Sometimes a poker is just for poking the fire and a knife just for whipping the top off your boiled egg.<br />
