First gig of the year was the Fortuna Pop! Winter Sprinter and was made up of three winners:</p>
<p><a href="http://flowersdomusic.bandcamp.com/">Flowers</a>, who <a href="https://soundcloud.com/fortuna-pop/flowers-stuck">released the best single of last year</a> on Fortuna Pop! opened. This was the fourth time I've seen them and they never fail to blow me away... and this time they managed the show without a mid-set pause to fix things.</p>
<p><em>They win on having the most astounding voice on stage and for coolest instrument.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://septembergirls.bandcamp.com/">September Girls</a> also released a rather brilliant 7",  and also on Fortuna Pop! </p>
<p><em>They win on coolest guitar strap and most inaudible between songs banter.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://joannagruesome.bandcamp.com/">Joanna Gruesome</a> released a whole rather brilliant album last year.</p>
<p><em>They win on relentless energy and covering Galaxie 500.</em></p>
