Like I guess far too many folk, until fairly recently my knowledge of Labelle extended no further than Lady Marmalade. I had no idea, for instance, that they weren't in fact just Patti Labelle let alone just how important Nona Hendryx was to the band.</p>
<p>In June 2011 Nona Hendryx appeared, with George Clinton at a talk about the British Library called "Space Children" that opened my eyes somewhat, although I have to admit that this is the first time I've listened to Nightbirds as an album, rather than just occasional dips into Labelle's catalogue.</p>

I think the thing most notable about Labelle is that Nona's lyrics were thoughtful and smart... and then they sang them dressed like this</p>

<p>And here's the hit (not written by Nona)</p>
