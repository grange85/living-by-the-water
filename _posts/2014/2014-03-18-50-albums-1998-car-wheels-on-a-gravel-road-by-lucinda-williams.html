Lucinda Williams' 1988 album was released by Rough Trade in the UK and is one I go back to often. On the strength of that I bought her next couple of albums, Sweet Old World and Car Wheels on a Gravel Road, neither had the charm or strength of the 1988 album, so I stopped buying her records and stopped listening to anything but my first one. So here I am listening to Car Wheels and it's not so bad... but all it really does for me is make me want to listen to a different album.</p>
