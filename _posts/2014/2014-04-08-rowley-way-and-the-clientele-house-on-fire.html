<p>I'm rather chuffed that <a href="http://theclientele.co.uk/">The Clientele are back</a>... and back as a three piece. Not sure how long for but now that a London date has been added, and I have my <a href="http://www.wegottickets.com/event/269194">ticket in the bag</a>, I can relax. I was scouring YouTube for an appropriate video to post and came across the video for House on Fire and spotted the awesome <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Road_estate">Rowley Way estate</a> in Camden (about 40 seconds in)</p>

<p>The estate also turns up in the video for A New England by the lovely and sadly missed Kirsty MacColl</p>

<p>Hazel and I happened upon Rowley Way completely by accident while walking around the area just after Christmas. It is a breathtakingly beautiful piece of brutalist architecture - and I know many might not think that beautiful and concrete can go together but just take a look at it - it really is amazing.<br />
