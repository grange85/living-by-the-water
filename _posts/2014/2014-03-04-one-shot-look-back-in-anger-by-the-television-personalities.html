<p>To-day I listened to Oasis' (What's The Story) Morning Glory? which I'll blog about later. To-day also, The Clientele announced they'll be <a href="http://www.mergerecords.com/suburban-light-reissue">releasing and improved and extended version of Suburban Light</a> (one of those things is CONSIDERABLY more exciting than the other!)</p>
<p>So here's how I get from one to another</p>
<p>Oasis - Don't Look Back in Anger</p>

{% aavid "r8OipmKFDeM" "" %}
<p>The Television Personalities - Look Back in Anger</p>

{% aavid "VnTq7EuaEsM" "" %}
<p>The Television Personalities - Picture of Dorian Gray</p>

{% aavid "WMbuZSfV41w" "" %}
<p>The Clientele - Picture of Dorain Gray</p>

{% aavid "ff9UiUu0Q5M" "" %}
<p>The Clientele - Saturday</p>

{% aavid "EB2KG52VyOc" "" %}
<p>BONUS - this started off as a "One shot" post but having changed it there was no space for Seam's rather good cover of Look Back in Anger... so I'm including it anyway.</p>
