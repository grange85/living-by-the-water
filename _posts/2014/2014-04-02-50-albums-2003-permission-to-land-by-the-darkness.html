I smiled all the way through it because it made me think I was listening to a serious 1981 album rather than a joke 2003 one. And what makes the joke all the better is that this album is better than most of the albums I bought between 1979 and 1982.</p>
<p>I'm genuinely surprised I liked this album quite as much as I did, I guess it just caught me right... but from the opening riff of Black Shuck I was pulled in.</p>
