... and so season 3, thankfully comes to an end. I didn't enjoy this season nearly as much as I thought I had. It had some great moments, but as a whole it really started to grate. Now I'm beginning to wonder if this is me changing. I decided a couple of years back that I couldn't be bothered with modern cinema's blockbusters, I didn't want CGI, I didn't want to <em>see the budget</em>, I wanted something that was able to get to me emotionally, rather than be battered into me, and I found I was not getting that from modern Hollywood. </p>
<p>I find that a lot of telly I've watched recently has had a similar effect, so, for instance one episode of <em>Peaky Blinders</em> and not much more of <em>Marvel: Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> or <em>Nashville</em> made it clear that this is not the sort of telly I want to watch (any more). I found rewatching <em>Twin Peaks</em> much more difficult than I thought it would be, I didn't make it to the end (although I started watching the first series of West Wing and that was still able to suck me in).</p>
<p>Obviously we're going to plough on with Buffy, and maybe I can get back into it (maybe Maggie Walsh and Tara will help), but at the moment it feels like I love Buffy less than I like, and like less than I just don't care about.</p>
<p>Graduation Day was an OK end, it had a cool/weird dream sequence, and the Faith/Buffy fight was OK. But I was relieved when it was over.</p>
<p>Maybe I've finally become... old, telly was much better in the olden days.</p>
<p>But you know it really was!</p>
