I'm not really a fan of music documentaries so despite having pre-ordered this (<del datetime="2014-03-21T22:35:23+00:00">it was crowd-funded</del><ins datetime="2014-03-21T22:35:23+00:00"> - not crowd funded - see comment below</ins>), and paid more for it than I'd generally pay for a DVD, I've never got around to watching it. I love the BMX Bandits and have caught them four or five times over the years; I knew a little about their history, you can't have an interest in 90s Scottish indie music without knowing where Duglas and the BMX Bandits fit into that, but somehow I wasn't really sure that I wanted to watch it.</p>
<p>It's a quaint film, it has interviews with the major players, and a fair quantity of archive footage. And it has Duglas, lots of Duglas. Duglas making tea, Duglas making cheese on toast, and Duglas opening up, but only a little bit, so we know there were problems but we don't get to hear what the problems really were (or are). And that's a good thing, for me at least, I don't want to know all the gritty details of the hard times, I just like the idea that no matter how hard the hard times are, someone will be around to help.</p>
<p>Sadly what the film lacks is any decent complete performances of any songs, and the DVD comes with no extras in this area either. I guess clearance became difficult or expensive, but to talk for 90 minutes about music without giving you even one complete performance is a disappointment... luckily, we have YouTube.</p>
