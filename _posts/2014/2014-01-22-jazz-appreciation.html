<p>I started <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/utaustinx/utaustinx-ut-8-01x-jazz-appreciation-1149">this (free) EdX Jazz appreciation MOOC</a> to-day (yeah! I know, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooc">I had to look it up too</a>), you can still sign up if you want to come join in!</p>
<p>I watched a bunch of videos, and listened to some music, and jotted down some words - I quite enjoyed having someone point things out to me, which would surprise anyone who was at school with me!</p>
<p>Here's some jazz I appreciate, by the end of the course I may be able to tell you why...</p>

<p>I also learnt that the nonsense spoken here is not all nonsense!</p>
