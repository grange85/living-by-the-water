<p>At work on Thursday a couple of colleagues and myself were discussing <a href="http://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/theatre-war-drama-special-operations-executive/">this splendid blog post discussing the training and "prop design" of the Special Operations Executive</a> ("Britain&rsquo;s secret warfare organisation during the Second World War").</p>
<p>Coincidentally on Friday Hazel and I watched the 1948 Ealing film "Against The Wind" and the amount of cross-over between the film and the blog post was quite a surprise.</p>
<p>Here are some observations...</p>
<p>In the blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>Camouflage wasn&rsquo;t just for people - it was also for &lsquo;props&rsquo;. Walter 'Wally' Bull [...] helped SOE develop explosive fake coal for sabotage [...] other camouflaged curiosities made by the section included fake animal droppings, for placing on roads and bursting the tyres of enemy vehicles, and explosive stuffed rats for damaging enemy facilities.</blockquote><img src="http://media.grange85.co.uk/swirling/blog/rats-explosive.jpg" width="640" height="317" class /> <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/worldwar2/theatres-of-war/western-europe/investigation/resistance/sources/docs/4b/">Exploding rat from the SOE Descriptive Catalogue of Special Devices and Supplies</a><br />
In Against the Wind: Scotty, a sabotage expert shows off, explosive coal, explosive animal droppings and explosive rats!</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Scotty</em>: Everything here blows up, this is explosive coal it's filled with plastic and is set off by a detonator</blockquote><br />
</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Scotty</em>: These rats, they're filled with explosive and thrown into the boiler room in a German explosive works, a chap sees one lying about, picks it up, throws it in the furnace and...<br />
<em>Michelle</em>: Bang!<br />
<em>Scotty</em>: Aye, aye just like that. Of course Jerry's got wise to the dodge now, but he spends an amount of time studying dead rats. Real ones as well as ours</blockquote></p>
<figure><img src="http://media.grange85.co.uk/swirling/blog/exploding-horse-manure.jpg" width="640" height="483" class /><figcaption> ... and some exploding horse poo</figcaption></figure>
<blockquote><p><em>Scotty</em>: Lumps of... mud.<br />
<em>Michelle</em>: Looks to me like horse manure.<br />
<em>Scotty</em>: Well, yes, it is actually. Put down in the road to wreck cars.<br />
</blockquote><br />
In the blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>Camouflaged items [...] were displayed in the Demonstration Room at the Natural History Museum, for the benefit of SOE personnel</blockquote><br />
In the Against the Wind: Father Elliot goes to the Natural History Museum for his initial recruitment into the SOE.</p>
<p>In the blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>There was also a make-up team, which could make delicate (or radical) changes to a person&rsquo;s face, allowing agents who were known to the enemy to re-enter occupied territory and continue their work in disguise.</blockquote>In Against the Wind: Emile Meyer has his face altered in preparation for an assignment, to the point where his wife doesn't recognise him</p>
<p>I was quite surprised that a film made so soon after the conflict was so open in discussing the methods used, I'd guess that the film-makers had a copy of the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/worldwar2/theatres-of-war/western-europe/investigation/resistance/sources/docs/4b/">Descriptive Catalogue of Special Devices and Supplies</a>.</p>
<p>Funnily enough a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=980CE5DE113CE23BBC4F51DFB0668382659EDE">contemporary review of "Against the Wind" from the NY Times</a> suggests that it...<br />
<blockquote>has the aspect of contrived melodrama and a minimum of the truth behind the sabotage of World War II</blockquote>... and describes it as "unconvincing fare". The National Archives' blog post clearly suggests otherwise!</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="http://www.thesharkguys.com/lists/10-animals-that-explode/">blog post that includes exploding rats along with nine other exploding animals</a>!</p>
