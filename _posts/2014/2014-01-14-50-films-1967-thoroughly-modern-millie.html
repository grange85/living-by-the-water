<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cowbearuk/4769037679/" title="THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE by cowbearuk, on Flickr"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4100/4769037679_95b15b2327_z.jpg" width="640" height="507" alt="THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE"></a>Ugh! The charm of Julie Andrews, the effortless villainy of Beatrice Lillie, the 20s (via swinging 60s) styles, and a couple of good song and dance numbers can't hide the fact that this is an appalling film. Dubious on grounds of race, of sex and with the always unbearable Carol Channing to totally kill it when you think there might be some salvation.</p>
<p>And no film signs off leaving as bad a taste in the mouth as this one does with this (near) closing line...</p>
<blockquote><p>I don't want to be your equal, I want to be a woman</blockquote></p>
<p>Truly, truly dreadful!</p>
