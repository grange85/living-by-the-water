<p>For the majority of the twenty odd years we've been living here, Sunday mornings from September to May have been soundtracked by the shouts, and whistles of multiple football matches being played on Warren Farm playing fields just on the other side of the canal. Recently Sunday mornings have been quiet. There's currently a political hoohaa going on over the future of the playing fields, the folk over at <a href="http://www.savewarrenfarm.com/">Save Warren Farm</a> explain the situation on their website.</p>
<p>This afternoon I wandered over there, it hadn't been my intention but the mud and puddles along my intended route sent me across the fields. The grass was long and there were no sports pitches marked out (you can see <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=three+bridges+southall&ll=51.500815,-0.346477&spn=0.005123,0.01295&t=h&z=17&iwloc=A">plenty in this satellite view</a>).</p>
<p>Here are a few pictures of the facilities<br />
