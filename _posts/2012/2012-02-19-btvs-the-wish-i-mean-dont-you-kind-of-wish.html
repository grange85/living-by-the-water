<p>So Anya turns up and, coincidentally (?) the show suddently gets better.<img src="http://media.grange85.co.uk/swirling/uploads/2012/02/thewish185-600x450.jpg" alt="" title="thewish185" width="600" height="450" class="size-medium wp-image-1862" /> The Wish is a gem, it has the good bits of Buffy (the darkness and the humour) mixed with the usual nonsense but in a favourable ratio. Joss gets to kill off heroes (or have them nice and (un)dead already) and he kills them with such relish...<br />

Also, while it's nice to see vampire Willow make another appearance later, I'd quite like to have seen more of hard-arse-Buffy too!<br />

Apologies for the screencap-heavy post.</p>
