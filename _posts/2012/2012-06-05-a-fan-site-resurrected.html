<p>Back in June 2008 I <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2008/06/13/my-top-6music-fan-sites/">wrote a post about my favourite "fan sites"</a> - I wrote about one of them...</p>
<blockquote><p>Another site that you have to head over to the Internet Archive to see it as it should be. I adored the Low website before it became official (and actually for quite a while after) but sadly a lot of the content has gone astray and it looks less like a fan site and more like what I guess it is now - a promotional resource.</blockquote></p>
<p>It turns out that as I was writing that the curator of that lost Low site was in the process of putting it back online - sadly it was four years (almost exactly) before I discovered that - but here it is - a great fan site, loaded with content (which is what a great fan site should be).</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.trustlow.com/">Low - Trustlow.com</a></strong></p>
<p>It was while playing my copy of <a href="http://www.trustlow.com/thesongs/joan.php">Low's exquisite Joan of Arc</a> that inspired me to look... this is the only thing I could find on youtube so maybe close your eyes and just listen!</p>
