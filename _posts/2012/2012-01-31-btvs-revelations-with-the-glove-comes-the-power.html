<p>Ahh... <a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Gwendolyn_Post">Gwendolyn Post</a> - I love Gwendolyn Post and really wish she'd been strung out for a few more episodes... I'd have loved to have seen her doing more English things with Giles - Giles needs more Englishness around him and Gwendolyn was just so gorgeously and perfectly English... </p>
<blockquote><p>there is talk in the council that you have become a bit too... American</blockquote></p>
<p>She deserved a nice three or four episode arc instead of being fried within one.</p>
<blockquote><p>The pictures are fun to look at, Mr. Giles, but one really ought to read the nice words as well</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>Faith! A word of advice, you're an idiot.</blockquote></p>
<p>As an aside... while I thoroughly appreciate <a href="http://www.screencap-paradise.com/caps/index.php?cat=2">Screencap Paradise</a> for providing me with most of the pics on this site - it's nowhere near as much fun as this <a href="http://unflatteringbtvscaps.tumblr.com/">Unflattering Buffy Screencaps</a>.</p>
