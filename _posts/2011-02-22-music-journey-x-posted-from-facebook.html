<p>Post a video to represent each of the subject matters below.<br />
Post the first song that comes to your mind to best represent the subject.<br />
Send on to a selection of your friends including me.<br />
Here's my list with choices beneath:</p>
<p><strong>A TUNE THAT MAKES YOU HAPPY/SMILE/LAUGH</strong><br />
Stereolab - Stomach Worm<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGuHbNq4NR8">Here's a listen video</a> -<br />
... and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcouJAZW29Y">here's a (live) watch one</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A TUNE THAT YOU HATE</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC04ZZploBE">Eric Clapton - Wonderful Tonight</a><br />
I hate this with all the hate that its possible to have - I scare myself just how much I hate it - the opening guitar line and those mawkish lyrics - it is a crime... I'm only posting a link because it's in the rules... don't click! </p>
<p><strong>A TUNE THAT YOU LOVE</strong><br />
Today it will be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNUs1avcW84">Galaxie 500 - Don't Let Our Youth Go To Waste</a> - on other days it will be other Galaxie 500 songs<br />
No idea what it has to do with Matt Dillon and Rumble Fish but it was the only video I could find</p>
<p><strong><br />
A TUNE YOU'D WANT PLAYED AT YOUR FUNERAL</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2xODjbfYw8">Fairport Convention - Who Knows Where the Time Goes</a><br />
Could have chosen any of a dozen Sandy songs...</p>
<p><strong>A TUNE THAT IS YOUR GUILTY PLEASURE</strong><br />
I don't think I have guilty pleasures - there is no music I love that I feel guilty for loving and I'm utterly convinced that it is all unquestionably cool but just to put something in here...<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0NpJ7mcfPo"><br />
Slade - Far, Far Away</a></p>
<p><strong>A TUNE FROM A FAVOURITE FILM OR TV SHOW</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtCNbERKvMs">Jacky - White Horses</a><br />
Loved this for ever so it was just an extra special treat that Dean & Britta covered it... twice</p>
<p><strong>A TUNE THAT YOU THINK NO ONE ELSE WILL KNOW</strong><br />
Schrasj - Tower<br />
Actually I've no idea if anyone else knows this or not - but it's awesome. I was sent a 7" of this in the early days of the Galaxie 500 mailing list - I tragically can't even remember who sent it... if it was you I am forever in your debt.<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIGD_xNw3Ts">Here's a live video (which I'd never seen before)</a><br />
And you can <a href="http://www.fantasticpop.com/catalog/004.htm">listen to (or download) both sides of the single over here</a> - do that!</p>
