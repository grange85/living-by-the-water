<p>Whenever I listen to metal these days it's mostly Motorhead or Sabbath which disguises the fact that my real metal period was the 1979 to 1981 golden period of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Wave_of_British_Heavy_Metal">NWOBHM</a>. Last September I did <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/?s=punk+special&searchsubmit=">a punk special on this blog</a> where I spent a day playing classic punk albums and passing opinion on them. It was a treat, the six albums I chose were shiny gems, every single one of them. I pondered doing the same today with NWOBHM - sadly some preliminary research revealed that it would be a painful chore of immense proportions. Most of the bands were unbearable and indistinguishable from one another. However, as a nod to my past I've picked one of my fave albums of that time - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxon_%28band%29">Saxon</a>'s 1980 album <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheels_of_Steel">Wheels of Steel</a> to represent NWOBHM on Everything's Swirling.</p>
<p>The album starts <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjEFL4-7y7k">with an archetypal metal opener</a>  - it has chunky riffs, screaming solos, wailed vocals... is about bikers... and is, quite frankly, awesome... not sure it'll get better than this.</p>
<p>I saw Saxon probably half-a-dozen times between '79 and 82 - most memorably a <a href="http://www.songkick.com/concerts/788988-saxon-at-rainbow-theatre">show at the Rainbow</a> in Finsbury Park which included a Hendrix-like guitar sacrifice, male nudity and is one of the few (non-Motorhead) shows from my HM days that sticks with me.</p>
<p>Track three is 747 (Strangers in the Night) ... which is about planes (a later album had a track about steam trains... they liked transport). I think this was a hit. Next up the title track and we're back to motorbikes... it may be all very macho but at least it's sparing the boasts of sexual prowess that I was expecting... or at least disguising it in transport-based euphemism! "She's cruising 140 she can do even more, I'm burning solid rubber, I don't take no bull"</p>
<p>I'm genuinely surprised how familiar I am with the album, and how I mostly don't mind it... but the weakness is Biff's vocal, it's a fairly classic metal delivery but doesn't have anything to lift it beyond that... it is relentlessly metal, which is a shame as the songs are good and the music is suitably heavy and the production fits all that perfectly. Now pop a Paul Di'Anno or a Gillan or an Ozzy on this...</p>
<p>Here's Saxon miming to Wheels of Steel on TOTP in 1980:</p><br />
