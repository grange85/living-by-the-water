<p>It's been nearly two years since I came across <a href="http://www.allloveisdead.com">Blanket</a> and in those two years I've still not managed to get off my lazy arse and go see them - despite numerous shows in London - only they never seem to head to the west and I really am too slack to cross town to see anyone. Anyway...I'm not sure how I became inspired to look them up again today - maybe it was just seeing them slipping down my last.fm charts that made me think that it is about time I checked up on them.</p>
<p>They're still playing, still <a href="http://www.allloveisdead.com/shows.htm">making regular trips to London</a> that I'm not going to, still <a href="http://www.allloveisdead.com/music.htm">putting shows on their website to download</a>, and still not <a href="http://www.woodlandrecordings.com/shop.html">putting out (m)any real releases</a> - although I love the homespun nature of the releases they have made.</p>

<p>But coming across a few lovely videos on YouTube was nice...<br />
