<p>Time to kick some life into Everything's Swirling. My intention is for more shorter posts so here's one.</p></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Bush">Kate Bush</a> will probably make many appearances in this series but as I was listening to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_%28album%29">Ariel</a> this morning and as I'm a sucker for bird noises - here are the pigeons (and other tweets) that open the second disc of her last album...</p><object class="aligncenter" width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/wH8C7tJ7rLQ&hl=en_GB&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/wH8C7tJ7rLQ&hl=en_GB&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></p>
<p>Ariel should have been in many more end of decade lists - including mine. Not sure where (or if) <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk">Hazel</a> published her list but I'm certain it was in there.</p></p>
