message: "Hello Both, its amazing where you get to when you are pootling about on the internet. I got to you thorugh some silent film images that andy put up - I followed his images and found your site. How lovely this all looks - I am so pleased for you and thanks for sharing it all. I fell in love with the North east when I visited as a child of 10. i've got a thing going on, which is what led me to you - please help if you can. I am trying to Save The Cinema Museum and its magnificent home, The Old Lambeth workhouse, a G2 listed building (once home of Charlie Chaplin, his mother and brother). I need help increasing the number of signatures to my petition. Our target is to significantly exceed 60,000 signatures - we are just shy of 58,000, so not far to go. Last week Martin Humphries and Ronald Grant, directors of The Cinema Museum were awarded the international Jean Mitry Award at the Pordenone Festival for their work in creating The Cinema Museum and using it to help support the heritage and the future of silent film. In the worlds of silent film and cinema history this award is a really BIG deal - and in making the award the Museum was referred to as a place of global pilgrimage for the world's silent film fans. But despite that great news, The Cinema Museum nears the end game in its fight for survival. We intend delivering our petition to 'Save the Cinema Museum' on November the 5th and launching the big final fight - once the petition is delivered, it is essentially closed - so this is everyone's last chance.  Please do what you can to help us over the line on this - by signing, sharing on social media, your newsletter, and sharing the link on emails etc. Here is the link, it only takes a minute or so.\r\n\r\nhttps://tinyurl.com/y9jgubrv\r\n\r\nthanks for reading this - please help if you can, it will make a huge difference and help us massively, love to Anwick!! Katharine from The Cinema Museum"
